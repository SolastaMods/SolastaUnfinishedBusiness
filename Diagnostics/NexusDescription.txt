This is a collection of work from the Solasta modding community. It includes multiclass, races, classes, subclasses, feats, fighting styles, spells, items, crafting recipes, gameplay options, UI improvements, Dungeon Maker improvements and more. The general philosophy is everything is optional to enable, so you can install the mod and then enable the pieces you want. There are some minor bug fixes that are enabled by default.

It uses a melee weapon, if it has one, or an improvised weapon or unarmed strike, if it doesn't. If multiple targets are within the creature's reach, it chooses its target randomly. If there is no target within the creature's reach, it attacks itself, against its own AC, dealing damage as normal on a hit.
