Background/&KS_GarradMilesBackground_Description=An orphan from the streets of Caer Cyflen, Garrad survived thanks to a little luck and a lot of stubbornness.\n He began as an apprentice cutpurse for the Thieves' Guild, but when he grew too big and too noticeable to melt into the crowds with a score, his masters decided that he would make a good crippled beggar.\n \n Unwilling to be maimed for the profit of others, he fled the Guild and the city by enlisting in the army.\n After a couple of years at a border fort near the Kingdom of Gallivan, Garrad hired himself out to merchants as a caravan guard, and spent time in several mercenary "free companies," raiding the Marches in the name of one noble or another. Based on his past experience, he dislikes thieves and their guilds, and shows no mercy to any underworld figures who cross him. \n \n As the Principality began looking for adventurers, Garrad returned to answer the call. More than anything, he hopes that one dark night, in some quiet alley, he will meet the sadistic guildmaster who planned to maim him for profit.

He harbors a deep-seated hatred of the New Empire, where he began his life as a slave.

Background/&KS_VigdisKaikonnenBackground_Description=Vigdis is the youngest daughter of Kaikkonen Vartija, the current head of the powerful Kaikkonen border clan in the Snow Alliance.\n Since girlhood she was known for her stubbornness and her strong sense of right and wrong. When she learned that her family planned to marry her into an allied clan for diplomatic reasons she left the Snow Alliance, one step ahead of a posse of brothers and cousins sent to recover her. \n Reaching the Principality of Masgarth, she sought sanctuary at the great temple of Einar, refusing to leave despite all remonstrations. Her father, the Kaikkonen himself, traveled to the temple in an unprecedented attempt at reconciliation, but she refused to be persuaded into the political match. Instead, she entered her novitiate in the service of Einar.\n While her family did not formally disown her, it is generally considered unwise to mention her name in their presence. Surprising everyone but herself, Vigdis excelled during her novitiate: offered her choice of service as a reward, she chose to join the wandering Order of the Beacon. Since then she has traveled widely, bringing the light of Einar to all in need and fighting and bleeding for them when necessary.\nEven though she treats all as equals and never puts on airs, her accent and choice of words betray a noble background and a good education, as well as a certain familiarity in dealing with powerful people. Vigdis is a hardy dwarf and a true follower of Einar, and her lifestyle in the Order of the Beacon matches her temperament perfectly.

Background/&KS_VioletGoodCheerBackground_Description=Violet is an unusual marsh halfling. Instead of staying safely at home in the reeds, her wanderlust has carried her far away, to the principality of Masgarth. \n To make things worse, instead of following the good and sensible path of the marsh mage that originated among her people, she has chosen to become a showy, destructive shock arcanist! \n Her family is mortified. Some of their neighbors whisper that the Good-Cheers have a trace of wild island halfling blood, and have never been sensible… though they are careful never to do so when they can be overheard.\n Violet is an idealist, and believes that it is better to be out in the world seeing things and doing good, rather than sitting grumpily in a swamp. \n She sees herself as the first of many Marsh Halfling heroes - well, mostly heroines, as she sees it - who will make the world a better place and win renown for themselves and their people. Her personal philosophy is based on freedom and personal accountability for one's actions.

CharacterFamily/&CelestialDescription=Celestials are creatures native to the Upper Planes.

Deity/&ArunDescription=The primordial god of the elements and patron of adventurers, peasants, hermits, and all others who value nature above civilization.\n The oldest of the Tirmarian deities, Arun is the one to whom humanity first prayed while struggling to survive in a hostile environment. His spouse is Maraike, the goddess of life and death.\n His clergy is divided into three main branches, each attached to one of Arun's powers: fire, ice, and lightning.
Deity/&ArunTitle=Arun
Deity/&EinarDescription=Einar is the god of valor and fidelity, and the patron of paladins, lawful warriors, and all those who bring light to darkness. The Church of Einar is organized into three Orders: \n The Blade is a militant order, a bulwark against chaos and evil.\n The Shield is an order of protectors, devoted to their flock.\n The Beacon is an order of itinerant preachers, helping the communities through which they travel with their strength at arms, their healing skills, and their knowledge of the law.

Deity/&MaraikeDescription=The goddess of life and death, the patron of healers and embalmers, and the embodiment of universal duality. Traditionally, she is Arun's wife.

Deity/&MisayeDescription=The goddess of mischief, protector of rogues and swindlers, and patron of all those who chafe against rules and enjoy a little chaos. \n Priests of Misaye seldom live a relaxing life.

Many lead a double life - normal citizens by day and priests of Misaye by night - because the cult of Misaye is outlawed in many nations and barely tolerated in most others.
Deity/&MisayeTitle=Misaye
Deity/&PakriDescription=The goddess of law and knowledge and patron of judges and lawyers, teachers, librarians, and scholars.\n She gifted humans with the thirst for knowledge so they could learn and develop their society, and the law which preserves civilization.

The Order of the Owl sends its members across the land to help those in need of protection and justice.

Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance_Description=Excerpt from "The Vale of Remembrance to the Vale of Dreams"
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance01=The Early Days of Coparann
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance02=Excerpt from "The Vale of Remembrance to the Vale of Dreams"\n By Kram Steelspine, Ceannard of the mines.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance03=We had heard rumors, and then most of the elven troops garrisoned in our Valley left through the Gates to meet a dire threat, yet with enough left behind to ensure that imperial law still reigned supreme! \n On this direst of days, the sky broke, lightning fell again and again, and - worst of all - magic failed! I remember quite vividly the ashen face of our resident wizard, a young scion of a minor branch of House Airgetine, as he told Eldoril Sharp-Blade, the officer left in charge of the Vale, that mana had disappeared and that he wasn't even able to light a candle with his magic.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance04=Eldoril Sharp-Blade, was a no-nonsense elven veteran who quickly realized that none of his contingency orders covered such an occurrence. Like every thrall, I was planning a rebellion against the imperial order. In the middle of the destruction wreaked by this Cataclysm, Eldoril made me realize that our fates were intertwined: Without magic, without the empire behind him, there was no way he would be able to compel us to behave like good little imperial thralls. On the other hand, some of his patrols had brought back the corpses of very dangerous-looking monsters, and his men had the equipment, discipline, and training needed to face such fearsome foes.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance05=If only it had been that simple… The young Airgetine wizard thought himself the equal of a master in wit, if not in power, and managed to convince his personal guard to follow him on a trek towards the imperial heartlands, away from the taint of this travesty of discussion with thralls. As Eldoril didn't want to pitch his troops against fellow elves, he let them go, with a heavy heart. It was the last we heard or saw of them.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance06=One year after the Cataclysm, I met my first humans. Eldoril was able to tell me they were not, as I had thought, enemies but rather refugees turned allies of the Empire. And what a sorry bunch they were: some elderly, children, women, not many fighting men among them, and they were following an old man, Egil Karst, decked in clothes the color of fire. This first winter had been more than dire, but somehow, the steep walls of our valley had shielded us, and we had room left to shelter those people, provided they could forage for their own food. At that, Egil Karst, the cleric of Arun, gave a little smile and, out of nothing, conjured up a feast for his followers.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance07=We were all dumbstruck, magic was returning… And yet, our few remaining arcanists confirmed they could not sense mana. Egil confirmed this, explaining that he was only a vessel channeling the mana offered by the gods so that his flock could survive. Those human gods were real, and their magic was functioning. And those humans were all skilled with their hands, not being used to having magic at their disposal for every single task. Soon, they weren't refugees anymore but valued members of our community, helping mend and repair with their hands and stone and wood, instead of with spells and mana.
Equipement/&Document_ValeOfRemembrance08=Their expertise was welcome as our foraging parties couldn't wander outside the fortress walls anymore, as the weather and the monsters had redoubled their assault. By now, even the fiercest of the anti-Manacalon among my miners approve of our tentative partnership with their erstwhile guards, as they have shown us that, no matter what their faults, their courage more than makes up for them. \n I am Kram Steel-Spine, the foreman of the mine, speaker to the elves, and Ceannard of the mines. Ceannard I remain, but of the whole Vale of Coparann, as we have chosen to rename our enclave. \n Strike true, fellow miners!
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Title=Book
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Description=Excerpt from "The Blood-Fang Invasion"\n By Ceannard, 8th of his name.
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content01=It all began as a series of raids, pinpricks outside our walls, attacks on caravans. Enough to worry us and elicit a response, but nothing more! Alas! it was a trick and the raids proved to be guided by a cunning hand able to predict our reactions with unerring accuracy.
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content02=And so the force we sent after the raiders got wiped out, almost to the last man. It was more than a raid from an orcish clan; it was a full invasion aimed at conquering our vale! We were almost surprised at the gates, but managed to close them in time! We had lost our finest but our walls were strong and we were able to produce weapons to replenish our depleted arrows and bolt stocks quite fast. This siege gave us pause, as we didn't quite understand its purpose. The only access to the Vale of Coparann goes through the pass blocked by our town and the fortress. The vale itself is only easily accessible if you can fly! Otherwise, the steep walls provide as fine a natural defense as I have ever seen!
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content03=And yet, they were so numerous that our numbers began to slowly dwindle, and we started to realize that we wouldn't make it on our own! And so I sent for my childhood friend, Joris Nikannen, using magical and also more mundane messengers to relay our plight!
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content04=Two weeks later, the orcs managed to break through our defenses and reach the inner court! The hour was dire and all able to bear arms were manning hastily erected barricades, as it was only a matter of time till the phalanx at the gate was worn down! And it was in that instance that Gromnir Stonefist and his mercenaries hit the enemy's rear! Fierce was his assault, but cunning too. A series of hit-and-run strikes from many directions, fireballs and lightning bolts exploding, and coming from what seemed like a thousand voices, war cries from known units of the Principality of Masgarth! The orcs thought the rescuers far more numerous than they were, and Captain Stonefist managed to strike hardest at the command group of the orcs, killing the blood shaman who was keeping the clans together. It broke their spirit! We had won, but the cost was great and the feeling in my mouth was mixed! Joris Nikannen saw it and found the words to shake me out of my gloom!
Equipement/&Document_BloodFangInvasion_Content05="Ceannard, you think its grim, and it is! But believe me, being on the losing side would be even worse, as the orcs would have slaughtered or enslaved us all, down to the last babes!"\n Ceannard the 8th - Chronicle of the Blood-Fang invasion

To this we deed no less than 10% of the land in the western valley!\n Issued in Coparann, 1005 AC, validated by acclamation

Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content=It has now been one week since we were transported to this wretched place! I think the gods have abandoned us! Of our monastery, the only building missing is the temple and its two resident priests! In its place, we have this weird construction, just out of reach of the pier, which we can't even enter. \n\n All the survivors are scared. They are turning to me for comforting words, but I am only a novice, not yet ready to be a priest. Like them, I am a refugee who fled Sorr-Tarr and his vile servant.\n \n I do not know where we are, but we are far from home. Our little valley is a small pocket of Tirmar, lost - I don't know where!
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content2=Strange beasts roam the night, but for some reason they do not dare to enter our valley.\n \n I buried my daughter last night. She died as much from despair as from the rockslide and the earthquake. Now, I wait for my own end.\n \nTraveler - if you read this, say a prayer for our souls, for I cannot. I reject the gods whose folly brought us here! I curse them all!\n \n The beasts have grown bolder, but they still avoid our valley. A pity, since I could use the meat. I am surviving on grain and vegetables, but solitude makes for hard labor and my strength is not what it was.
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content3=It has been 40 years. I am the last one, an old man now! I buried them all - all! But I could not bring myself to give the last rites. No - the gods left us to rot here, and I refused to send our souls back to them!\n \n Emtan Darwaz, last of the Sandblaze Monastery

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_Description=A locked book containing Aksha's notes since her arrival at the Keep.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text1=Lizzaria sent another party of her stupid zombies. One of them was an ogre, as if that would make things harder. Reek and Filth took care of it - I didn't even have to walk out. When will she understand that her attempts are useless? I'm getting tired of pretending to ignore who sends these monsters. I'm also getting tired of Mardracht. The old elf is powerful, for sure, but his mind is in decay. While he barricades himself in his solar, I've read all his damn books, but learned almost nothing.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text2=A Doom Gem. It took me forever to imbue it enough power to make it worthwhile. I still don't understand how the wizards of Manacalon could have done it in less than a year. Anyway, now I could use it to craft a nice weapon, but to what end? Killing Lizarria's zombies? I'm losing interest in the project now the difficult part is done. I don't need a magic dagger to make my enemies bleed.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text3=Reek is a good minion. He used to be handsome, but undeath doesn't suit him. Now he's just an obedient little pawn. Who would guess he was once a nobleman? I kept his armor and shield - he doesn't need them any more. Filth was always scum, but now at least she is of some use. She brings corpses to feed the ghouls, so I don't have to walk through piles of rotting fools. I'm thinking of creating another Brood, though. A nice, meaty Brood of Flesh would be nice. Maybe next month.

The war is not over, and we must also face these Manacalons.\n They wield magic as potent as that of any priest, yet the High Priest assures us that there are no gods in this world.\n These are dark times, and they will test us, but this world is our last hope.\n May the Lord of Valor watch over you, my love.\n Artus

Equipment/&HectorLetterContent1=It was a bad plan; I said so from the start. It took me a month to master Griff's full appearance and a year to build the spider cult. The orcs are now loyal to me and eager to follow me to war, but the Scavengers have found the city and started encroaching on the orcs' territory. I decided to use the orcs ahead of schedule and wipe out the Scavengers. There were only a dozen of them, but they put up more of a fight than I expected, and I had to change the plan again. I sacrificed more orcs to capture their leader, a man named Hector. I will cancel the operation with the spider cult, and take the appearance of this Hector. A prominent member of the Scavengers could be useful. I must spend time alone with him deeper in the ruins, where the orcs don't go.

The mission is a complete failure and I will answer to the Tshar - if I survive. I will try to escape by climbing up the amphitheater, but the spiders might be too fast for me. Glory to Sorr-Tarr!

Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Title=A handwritten, leather-bound book
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Description=The Journal of Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content01=If found, please return to the Guild of Antiquarians at Caer Cyflen. A reward will be offered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content02=Surroundings, continued …castle architecture is of First Expansion style, with many repairs and additions. A standard founding plaque: "Caer Tenarion", built by the 25th Iron Legion in the 24th year of Gwaltrian the Third - year 1557 in the Manacalon calendar, or 1486 before the Cataclysm. Presumably built to pacify the surrounding area.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content03=Later, same day. My initial impression confirmed: the castle is occupied. I encountered a patrol of skeletons led by a wraith who gave his name as Adam the Twelfth, a former Imperial officer and now captain of the castle's guard. He questioned me closely and gave me permission to research outside the castle, but not to approach the castle or try to enter. The lord, whose name he gave as Mardracht, does not receive visitors. Indeed, the captain admitted that he himself had not seen or spoken with his master in several centuries.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content04=Graveyard, continued …no gravestone shows a burial date later than the Cataclysm: no new burials in more than a thousand years. Possibly all in the castle are undead, like their guards. Impossible to confirm since I am refused admission.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content05=Substantial mausoleum at far end of the cemetery, built in First Expansion style. Inscription over doorway names 25th Iron Legion. Presumably officers were buried inside (and possibly in catacombs beneath, if the building filled up over time) while lower ranks occupy the surrounding graveyard.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content06=The following day, continued …as I continued to document the graveyard, a pack of wolves arrived from the north, led by a human man - or so he seemed. Met by captain and guards. Conversed for several minutes, manner guarded but not unfriendly. The captain pointed in my direction, clearly informing the man of my presence. No one in the group showed any interest in me.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content07=Later, same day: An elven woman came out of the mausoleum, accompanied by several others: elves and humans, all apparently alive. They could not have entered the mausoleum without my seeing them. Two questions arise:
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content08=Another way into the mausoleum? Possible catacombs beneath - underground passage into the castle?
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content09=2. Living souls in the castle, yet no burials newer than 1,000 years? Two possibilities: life magically prolonged (necromancy? Fits with undead guard I encountered) and/or bodies not buried upon death (also compatible with necromancy).
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content10=I watched from hiding as they explored the graveyard, apparently looking for something (me?). Extreme caution is indicated from now on.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Title=Lizzaria's Journal
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Description=A series of hand-written pages
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content01=…upstairs to try to speak with Mardracht about it, but Aksha said he was resting and had left orders not to be disturbed - as usual. She offered to pass on a message - so helpful! - but I know it will never reach him.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content02=For all I know she's told him I'm dead. She may be planning to make it true. He's so shaken and addled from the Cataclysm, he'd probably believe her. She could have killed him already - he could have been dead for centuries - but no: his magical defenses are still in place. He must be alive.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content03=If only I could reach him - free him from her influence - but I can't get past her and her ghouls. So frustrating! I need to arrange a sudden meeting with a wooden stake, but she's careful.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content04=Adam's no help. He won't join me against Aksha without orders from Mardracht, which of course can't come because she's got him isolated. How blind is he not to see that - I'll never yield the castle to her, no matter what she does. While Mardracht lives, I have to keep trying to save him.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content05=…searching the graveyard as usual. The dwarf was there - he always thought I didn't see him, but I did - but now he's a ghost. Adam said he was an Antiquarian, some sort of scholar, so I tried to control him and find out what he knows.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content06=I was over-eager, though, and he got away. An opportunity lost. He might know something that could help me get past Aksha and her ghouls and free Mardracht from her influence. Someday, somehow, I will get rid of her. I will.

Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Title=On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Description=An ancient-looking book, with the eight rings of the Arcaneum embossed into the cover.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content01=On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods, and Its Particular Implications for Necromancy. By Alithariel Threanin, Postulant Junior Master of the Arcaneum, School of Necromancy. Academic Session of 3044, Imperial Calendar
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content02=As my thesis in support of my candidacy for the rank of Junior Master of the Arcaneum at the School of Necromancy, I respectfully submit the results of my research into the nature and types of new magics brought to Solasta by the humans of Tirmar, in particular the effectiveness of those whom they call "clerics" in repelling and destroying undead creatures. This knowledge is of urgent importance as we struggle to understand these humans, and assess both the severity of the threat they may post to the Empire and the potential benefit they could bring to it once conquered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content03=It is widely known that the magic of humans derives from the entities they call "gods" ("goddesses" in the feminine, and "deities" collectively). I call it "divine magic" in this thesis, to distinguish it from our own arcane magic that is the result of magical study. Just as arcane magic is organized into schools, some divine magic is comprised of eight areas of study, which the humans call "domains." Each deity typically provides its clerics with access to two domains, representing its particular interests. The domain that corresponds most closely to the School of Necromancy is called the Domain of Oblivion.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content04=In addition to spells from two domains, a cleric has access to a wide array of other spells and powers, which are common to all regardless of their patron deity. Many are broadly similar in their effects to the spells of the School of Necromancy. There are two necromantic powers, though, that are completely new and unique: a cleric of any Tirmarian deity, if their rank is high enough, can repel undead creatures and even destroy them. The humans I have questioned believe that this is because their deities regard all undead creatures as "unnatural" - a word that reveals much about their primitive level of sophistication - and therefore undesirable, but they seem to know nothing about the means by which this result is achieved, speaking only about the "will" or "power" of their deities.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content05=The following pages examine the phenomenon of "turning" and destroying undead using both the classical thaumatological approach of Fathirien and her successors, and the more modern methods championed by Gorlindrien and the Practicalists. All conclusions are tentative. If this thesis is accepted, I propose to make this phenomenon my primary research topic.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Title=Torn Page
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Description=A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content01=…as the Soraks followed humanity, a high priest of Oblivion succumbed to despair and madness. He tainted the peace of the grave with the uncleanliness of undeath, raising the fallen to muster an army. As he knew this was not a prayer that would gain the favor of Maraike, the lady of life and death, he and his followers couched their plan in the form of a curse instead, tricking their goddess into ensuring that their plan would succeed. Maraike granted their plea, but was not deceived. She cursed the conspirators as well, for they had been corrupted by evil and were denied her grace. They became the fallen, and those they raised from death became sorrow zombies, named after the curse of sorrow that they had wrought.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content02=Maraike's punishment ensured that none of the fallen could enjoy the touch of light without suffering and dying. They must forever skulk in the shadows until they repented. But Maraike's punishment was not all. Sorr-Tarr, the vile god of the Soraks, saw potential in the fallen. Without undoing Maraike's curse, he gave them powers to do evil: to corrupt others by their touch, and to create fouler servants than zombies. Of the original fallen not much is known, save that there were twelve of them, priests and paladins…
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Title=Torn Page
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Description=A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content01=…the humans explained that they had fled to Solasta from their home, a world they called Tirmar, and that they were pursued by a race they called Sorr-Akkath or Soraks, which had spread across this world of Tirmar, and threatened to conquer all others.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content02=The Governor received them with the appearance of kindness, reasoning that if they came as supplicant fugitives it would be an easy task to subdue them, and either set them to work as slaves alongside the inferior races of Solasta or bind them over to the wizards of the Arcaneum for dissection or whatever other form of study might prove most fruitful. When the guards sought to bind the humans, though, they called upon beings they called "gods," and manifested powerful magics that took their hosts by surprise. Thus they were able to escape.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Title=Torn Page
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Description=A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content01=…deities of Tirmar are a source of a new and unknown kind of magic. The humans believe they are powerful entities, perhaps extraplanar in nature, whom they worship and whose commands they follow, receiving power in return.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content02=The humans are careful to distinguish between "good" and "evil" deities. "Good" deities are those whom the humans see as helpful to them, and - in their theology at least - concerned with their welfare. "Evil" deities are those who are hostile to humans and support the efforts of other races to conquer them. It was an "evil" deity and his followers - one Sorr-Tarr and the race of the Sorr-Akkath, or Soraks - who drove the humans to try to escape their home world of Tirmar, they say. Their arrival on Solasta…
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Title=The Time of the Dragons
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Description=An old book with the image of a dragon embossed on the cover.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content01=There was a time, very long ago, when dragons were the rulers of Solasta. They lived in the mountains, close to volcanoes which they loved for their heat - for nothing else was hot enough to incubate a dragon's egg. At that time the dwarves had not yet come up from below ground, being more rock than flesh, and the halflings remained in their swamps, far from anyone. And what of the elves? The elves were in and of the air, without physical form but existing as swirling currents of air and mana, one with magic and with the world.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content02=Eventually, however, the elves tired of a life of pure spirit and wind. They took a physical form and began to build great spires and palaces, bringing the beauty of their thoughts into material being. The dragons feared them, and a great war ensued, pitting fire and magic against air and magic until the elves…
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Title=The Good Management of Servants
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Description=An old book that seems to have been well-thumbed.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content01=The supreme duty of the head of a household is the management of servants. This is more important even than the welfare of the family, because a household can survive internal strife and injustice, but it cannot survive a breakdown in discipline. Heed well the lessons of history, and keep thoughts of revolt from the minds of your slaves.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content02=Remember that no matter how intelligent and endearing they may seem, your non-elf slaves are animals, nothing more. Do not indulge them, but give them every day a new reason to fear your wrath and a fresh reminder that your power is absolute. It is not going too far, if you can afford it, to select one at random now and again for death by torture. As well as providing entertainment for your guests and an example for your children, this practice instils a healthy…

This plaque was cast from brass melted in a furnace fueled by the bodies of their faithless slaves, both living and dead.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Title=The Great War against the Dragons
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Description=An ancient book.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content01=The dragons saw how the elves were changing the world, bringing beauty to blasted volcanic wastes, and living green to barren fields of rock. They had never seen beauty before, nor heard music; their language was devoid of poetry, and their magic was brutal and without wonder.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content02=The dragons fell in love with the elves, as all do who see them. They longed to possess them, for dragons are avaricious by nature. With sweet words and trickery they enslaved a few of the fair people, but most elves were not taken in by the dragons' flattery, and prepared to resist them.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content03=Great battles were fought, blade against flame, and magic against magic. Mountains were leveled, and land sank to make the Inner Sea. The tunnels where the dwarves hid in fear were flooded. It was in that bloody crucible that our people's mastery of magic was forged, and the elven race united under the first Emperor Ilmathir Ellanion.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content04=The war against the dragons lasted for three generations before the Warrior Empress Cythaeriel Ellanion, the Lady of the Bright Blade, led the elves to…

Equipment/&Evocation_Plaque1_Content01=In memory of the Emperor Laethar Aerlinn, first of his name, who reigned from the year 1773 until 2117 and oversaw the glorious expansion of the Empire, subjugating the rebel elves of the forests, the dwarves of the western mountains, and the halflings. Hero of the Forest of Flames, where he slew more than a hundred rebels with his own hand. Treacherously slain by rebel arrows during the advance on Colthannin.

Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Title=Illusion and Substance: A Primer
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Description=A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content01=…as Master Irillien of the Arcaneum wrote in his great work "On the Nature of Illusion and the Question of Reality," "Many illusions, if believed, are as effective as if they were real; conversely, some realities, if ignored, may be avoided. Which, then, is more valid? What, indeed, is real, or reality? Was our great Empire, and our rightful mastery of the world and all who dwell therein, not a dream, which is a form of illusion, before our Iron Legions and our arcanists made it real?"
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content02=There is some merit, therefore, in avoiding a distinction between illusion and reality, but regarding them instead as two poles of a continuum. Some things are entirely real, and some things are entirely illusory, but the numbers of each are far fewer than is commonly supposed. Most things lie somewhere in between, partaking of the natures of illusion and reality in differing proportions. Those who seek a true understanding of the nature of things, and the distinctions…
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Title=Human Gods and Their Magic
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Description=A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content01=…exploration of the planes outside our own revealed the existence of all manner of strange entities, some of them exceptionally powerful. It is to be supposed that the world of Tirmar, from which the humans came with their gods, belongs in one of these planes, which somehow collided with our own during the events leading up to the Cataclysm, instead of remaining safely confined beyond a magical portal.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content02=The reason for this is unknown. Several theories have been put forward, but none has been proven. Although they vary in their finer details, many theories blame the deity Sorr-Tarr, from whom the humans and their gods were fleeing as they entered Solasta. The scholars of the Arcaneum do not fully understand the class of beings called "gods" or "deities," and while their human followers proudly assert that their powers are without limit, it is clear that this cannot be the case, or the Cataclysm would have been prevented. Still, this Sorr-Tarr, being a powerful entity of this class, might have sought to open the Rift wider, in order to facilitate the pursuit by his Sorr-Akkath followers and complete…
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Title=On Those Who Came from Tirmar
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Description=A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content01=…humans and Sorr-Akkath are thought to be the only mortal beings to cross from Tirmar, the question of orcs and their kin must be taken into account. Human accounts of the matter are confused and often contradict each other, but a careful reading of the best sources suggests that the orcs were once human, and were altered by the wild magics that accompanied the closing of the Rift.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content02=The human ancestors of the orcs were members of wild barbarian tribes from the more remote parts of Tirmar. Ferocity and courage in battle were the highest values in their culture, so when the forces of our two worlds combined at the Battle of the Rift, it was these tribes who sought out the most dangerous locations in order to win the most glory by the values of their culture. This brought them very close to the Rift itself, and therefore made them most vulnerable to the unpredictable magical energies that flared out from it. All of those who fought beside them perished, even the elite of the Iron Legions - but somehow these barbarians, strong of mind and strong of body, were able to survive. However, their bodies and minds were both affected, and they became the first orcs to exist in both worlds.

That was the start of it all. Soon, all eyes turned to the Badlands. The thirst for the forgotten secrets of the Old Empire was growing.\n \n The rest is scribbled.

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_Marches_Document02_Description=We were still reeling from the Cataclysm, learning to cope with the absence of mana. Some of our arcanists have even died from mana starvation. And at night, the attack came! Huge creatures, insects, coming out of the ground, grabbing victims and vanishing again…\n One of the refugees, a dwarf, said the creatures were redeemers, and one of my sub-officers confirmed this. Somehow, those monstrosities had found our valley and were stalking us! Only solid stone protects us from their surprise assaults. \n Our foraging parties are ambushed daily and we keep losing troops. And yet, without foraging, we will starve. \n …\n This is my last entry. One huge redeemer managed to dig through the stone, and they are pouring into our fortifications!

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeCaptureGiantReport_Description=Hasdrubal: \n My patrol stumbled upon some tracks in the middle of the swamp, not far from base. Looks like giants. One seemed to be stalking the others, or possibly running from them. It was hard to tell. We took one prisoner, at no small risk to our hides. Be advised that we are bringing back a prisoner who will need a very secure cell.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeCaptureGiantHasdrubalOrders_Title=A Dangerous Guest
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeCaptureGiantHasdrubalOrders_Description=Giants are too powerful to be left wandering around, and besides, this one knows the location of our camp. Capture the creature and keep it in chains until further notice.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeDryadThreatReport_Title=Tree of Death
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeDryadThreatReport_Description=Hasdrubal: \n While on patrol, Garral camped near the big tree with his troops. In the morning, everyone was dead except one sentry who neither saw nor heard anything. \n We just had word from some merchants who had set up camp near the same tree, and their sentry tells an identical tale. \n Also, one of our patrols found the corpses of several troops in the livery of Orenetis not far from this same tree. While our troops shed no tears over their fate, concern is spreading about this tree. I strongly recommend that some action be taken. We've chased dryads away from that tree. Maybe it's them, somehow, retaliating.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeOrcSwampBaseReport_Title=A Heavy Raid
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeOrcSwampBaseReport_Description=Hasdrubal: \n One of our patrols reports that an orc raiding party has settled in the old fort: you know the one. They are using it as a base to raid through the swamp as well as to strike at targets nearer the city, which, of course, brings unwanted attention in our direction. Please send someone to convince them to move away.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeWanderingElfReport_Title=Lonely Traveler
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeWanderingElfReport_Description=Hasdrubal: \n Some of our scouts spotted a solitary elf traveling alone. From his gear, he looks to be a mage, but his purpose is unclear. A spy? Someone sent to the swamps as a punishment? I suggest someone make contact and talk to him, but this should be done far away from the camp.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeRebelMeetingReport_Title=Trouble with the Rebels
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeRebelMeetingReport_Description=Hasdrubal: \n I think it is time you involved yourself directly in our meetings.

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportUndead_Description=Hasdrubal: \n A patrol reports undead activity near the old bridge. This is new as the area was quiet before. We should investigate. Perhaps some idiot opened an opulent tomb, and we only need to find the entrance. \n I just hope it isn't some hidden necropolis with scores and scores of undead inside. That would force us to redirect resources from many operations until we are able to resolve the issue.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportTrolls_Title=Tunnel and Trolls!
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportTrolls_Description=Hasdrubal: \n During our last patrol, we spotted some trolls entering the big caves. They were too many for us to fight, so we waited and watched. They seem ready to settle down there, and one of my scouts swears there were some young trolls among them. As the caves are near one of our main routes, this spells trouble. Please send reinforcements immediately - and make sure they bring lots of torches and oil. We'll need them!

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_OrenetisDraconicStudy_Title=Polymorphing Report
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_OrenetisDraconicStudy_Description=The problem isn't physical. As far as we can tell, our Lord Protector is healthy. That he can't revert to his higher form…\n  …can only mean that there is one fundamental aspect of the process that we fail to grasp. \n Therefore, we must continue to experiment on the most diverse array of subjects possible, morphing animals and even those ridiculous pets that druids dare to call kindred spirits. In these links and experiments, we shall find the key to free our Lord.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport01_Title=Hybrid Dire Wolves - Progress Report, Phase Three
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport01_Description=The changes we wrought on the dire wolves enhanced their aggression and ferocity. They look ugly and their stench can be overwhelming, but when we pitted them against unaltered pure breeds of their kind, there wasn't even a contest. The second test involved armed runaway rebels, who were also slaughtered with ease. All in all, the program is delivering on its initial promise. The next step will be to ensure that the mutations carry over to the next generation.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport02_Title=Hybrid Bears - Progress Report, Phase Four
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport02_Description=My Lord: \n As you know, our work with the bears has been very successful. Their ferocity and strength are unrivaled. They are truly fearsome. But there is better news yet. Last night, one of our bears gave birth to two healthy cubs, showing all the signs of our work. We have made the changes hereditary! However, the ferocity of the species is such that the young did not survive long, as their first mewling caused their enraged father to kill them.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport03_Title=Hybrid Bulette - Progress Report, Phase Two
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport03_Description=My Lord: \n Phase two of testing is complete. The bulette shows much promise: its carapace is harder, its enhanced muscles give it added jumping capabilities, and its jaw can even crush rocks. To proceed with phase three of testing, we will need worthwhile adversaries to push it to its limits and prove the success of the work so far.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ResearchReportOnSitenero_Title=Special Guest - Monthly Report
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ResearchReportOnSitenero_Description=To our Lord Protector, Orenetis the Benevolent: \n My Lord, the behavior of our guest follows its usual patterns: long periods of contemplation, some calisthenics, and not much in the way of conversation. Somewhat unusually, there was no attempt at bribery during this observation period. I might hope that he has learned better than to try it, but I suspect he plans to lull us into relaxing our guard. Not that we would do that after the mishap twenty years ago. The fate of that set of guards was a stark reminder of the price of shirking one's duty.

Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Title=Report of Interplanar Experiments
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Description=This book is entirely written in the draconic language. It contains illustrations of monstrous creatures with horns, wings, and fangs.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content01=My work on Gates has led me to an intriguing proposition. If my calculations are correct, the Gates function by creating a path between two points, passing through another dimension. In so doing, they create a path that is shorter than one that remains entirely within our own. If there are dimensions - or planes, or universes, call them what you will - other than our own, it follows that there may be worlds in those dimensions, and inhabitants of those worlds, and who knows what other discoveries waiting to be made? I must investigate this further.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content02=Initial work on the planar travel project - as I have decided to call it - has been slow and frustrating. There are intricacies to the tuning of dimensional harmonics which go far beyond those for travel across Solasta that have required me to create an entirely new branch of mathematics. In addition, the mana requirements are exponentially larger, and have led to some unfortunate effects in the mile or so around my experimental Gate - fortunately, these were fairly easy to contain.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content03=More difficult were the identification and acquisition of sufficiently robust materials for the vital components of the modified Gate. These became necessary after early experiments left entire assemblies melted or even vaporized. A rare metal from the northern mountains shows promise, although a dragon is unlikely to be welcome there. I am practicing with a halfling polymorph persona, and am hopeful of obtaining what I need through this subterfuge.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content04=My Major Gate experiments have borne fruit at last. After several failed attempts took me all across the face of Solasta, I at last reached a completely new location. At first, I thought I had landed in the far north of Ferendragh, for my surroundings were cold and icy. However, the architecture of the ice-cut palace in which I found myself was not Manacalon, nor in the style of the Snow Alliance, and the creatures I encountered were as far from Snow Dwarves as I could imagine. I soon realized that I had stumbled upon a place of evil, full of vile creatures hungry for chaos and destruction. They call themselves demons.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content05=Though most of the denizens of this ice palace were no match for a Manacalon dragon, their ruler was another matter entirely. I had already learned that this creature's name was Sessroth and that it went under a variety of epithets and sobriquets, each more violent than the last. In truth, I found all of them to be well deserved, for I was hard pressed to return to Solasta and write this report. Alas, I soon realized I had been followed by Sessroth through a hole left in the interplanar fabric, a hole I myself had made. When demons started flowing through, I had no choice but to call upon my sister Adrasteia, for she is the master of Abjuration.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content06=Together, we fought Sessroth and gravely wounded him, tearing apart one of his arms, but at the moment that death struck him, he was gated back to his own plane. We pursued him only to find him sat on the throne of his Palace of Ice, regenerated and surrounded by many powerful allies. Adrasteia improvised a spell to seclude them in the palace. We returned home, exhausted. In the meantime, demons had ravaged many villages of the Snow Alliance and been defeated at great cost, leaving a trail of grief and despair among the people who had so kindly helped me gather precious metal for my experiments.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content07=Adrasteia told me her spell could never hold against the power of so many demons, unless a constant effort and flow of mana was maintained. She had used Sessroth's bone to link the spell to the Archreaver, forbidding him above all to gate to Solasta, but she needed a sacrifice from me too, one that I was only too willing to make since I had been the cause of the situation. I offered up five of my claws so that I would be forever linked to the spell myself.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content08=In addition, to prevent an invasion in the unforeseeable future, the spell needed more strength. Under the cover of my halfling wizard persona, I explained to the lords of the Snow Alliance that they too needed to give up something of themselves to protect their land against the demons. Five clan leaders agreed to swear an oath to maintain the spell, each bearing one of my claws to draw from their lifeforce, to keep the Palace of Ice on its plane and prevent interplanar travel to Solasta. The damage done by a handful of greater demons was enough for them to accept and take the oath, forming the Pact of the Claw.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content09=They have pledged on their honor that the barriers will be maintained, and that the responsibility for doing so will be passed down to their heirs and successors forever. The fact of a passage to another plane is to be kept a closely guarded secret, for fear of inciting the curiosity of others like me who might be tempted to open the way and doom our whole world in doing so. Though not all the peoples of the Snow Alliance are of dwarven stock, all share, more or less, in the dwarven sense of honor, and I am satisfied that they and their descendants will keep their word.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_SessrothReport_Content10=I shall now exercise greater care, and step away from further interplanar travels. As per my sister's request, I will return to Telema with my experimental Gate and begin teaching the new generation of elves.

The crossing of the mountain was hard, but the hope of finding you took the pressure off my legs. And what about the view once up there! I arrived just before the storm hit. Master Goldentongue's caravan didn't drag on; you can tell they are used to these conditions. But here I am, in town. I hope to be able to hold you in a short while.

Everything is fine, but poor Berghild looks exhausted from the trip. I think she's worried, but I'm not sure why. You met her last time, I think.

Equipment/&AbyssalAgitatorInstructionsContent01=An unintended boon discovered in my myriad encounters with demon-kind has been that the essences of their spirit and mana are often left behind as a viscous substance once their host is killed.

Equipment/&DLC3_Einareum_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content02=Having spent years trading with the people of the Snow Alliance, I have found there are a few things one ought to know if one wishes to understand both them and their culture.

Equipment/&DLC3_Einareum_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content06=…Upon returning to the Principality for my last trade mission, I found that, like my adoptive clan, I too had become cautious of southern strangers and mistrusting of their too obvious motives. I now looked upon the soft hands and faces of the people of Masgarth and saw their eyes light up with avarice, grasping at the beautifully crafted gems and jewels I brought with me. It was only the Principality's gold and the much-needed supplies they would buy that helped calm those fears…

Equipment/&DLC3_Einareum_Lore_SurvivingTheGreatWhite_Content02=…The clues took me ever north from Masgarth, north into the cold mountains of the Snow Alliance and then beyond. A whispering voice beckoning me onwards. I needed to see if the rumors I had heard were true. What would I find? The people of the clans thought I was mad, foolish, or both. In hindsight, I now wonder at my own sanity. What possessed me to push on so far? There is a reason the people of the Snow Alliance call it the Great White…
Equipment/&DLC3_Einareum_Lore_SurvivingTheGreatWhite_Content03=Arwin wanders off topic in order to describe the passing scenery and his journey to the north for several pages…
Equipment/&DLC3_Einareum_Lore_SurvivingTheGreatWhite_Content04=For that reason, I made sure to craft Boots of the Winterland, forged Armor of Frost Walking, and just for good measure took my Ring of Cold Resistance and a Scroll of Fire Shield. \n  \n  In my second week, far north of Valkarokkopun, one of the Great White's lethal blizzards descended, howling from the north, roaring death in my ears.

Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GuideCity_Description=How White Rock City is organized and how it was constructed.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GuideCity_Content01=The roots of our mountains run deep, but none deeper or as wide as blessed Valkarokkopun, known in the common tongue as "White Rock City." Although our ancient metropolis has a history lost in time, we know that the Manacalon elves had yet to defeat the dragon menace when we mined the first of the finest marbles, granites, and fabulous quartz of rarest quality from the mountain's veins.\n  When the Manacalon Empire first attacked us, the Clan Kaakkoinen were already constructing fortifications.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GuideCity_Content02=Valkarokkopun was by then a large city fueled by the discovery of veins of almost pure gold, silver, and flawless precious gems, positioned on a strategic pass linking the southern lands with the endless Great White to the north. The city not only expanded down through the mountain, using marvels of our dwarf engineering that include complex elevators, ventilation, and heating, but also out to the north and south, with substantial fortified areas in concentric rings.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GuideCity_Content03=Since then, the Kaakkoinen, now known in the common tongue as the Kaikonnen, have built ever larger, more complex fortifications and many technological marvels within.

Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Content01=Blood and stone! \n  When first I heard this tale from Masgarth, I was much disposed to be doubtful of the events that I record here. But now having discussed them with those Antiquarians present at Caer Cyflen, I must admit to sharing no small sense of wonder. And why, you may ask? \n  It appears we have now roaming Ferendragh, mighty folk who show the insight, cunning, and dogged determination one would normally expect of folk from the Snow Alliance!
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Content02=Four brave adventurers, first deputized to the Legacy Council, and now Heroes of Masgarth. \n  As we all know, Princess Ceiwad Silverflower hasn't seemed most focused when discussing matters of import, despite her good intentions. So, it was with much surprise that her hiring of four deputies brought the most astounding destruction of a devious plot to infiltrate and overthrow the Principality. A plot by the Sorr-Akkath, a force of legendary evil that, it turns out, was real!
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Content03=It turns out these Sorr-Akkath were lurking in the ruins and wastes of the Badlands, and had begun to spread east, hiding in shadows, plotting to defile and destroy all that is good in the world. I have no doubt that there are nefarious folk among the New Empire and Gallivan that are to blame. We know how much they covet the lands of Masgarth. Filthy southerners.\n  But I digress. Allow me to continue with my tale…
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_MasgarthEvents_Content04=This volume continues to tell a sometimes wildly inaccurate tale of the Heroes of Solasta.

Strangers shipwrecked and washed up on the shores of a strange world. But the dwarves and elves of the Snow Alliance saw that we were indomitable, trustworthy, and - most importantly - skilled. When the mana drained from the world during the Cataclysm, those skills became a lifeline that none could live without. A binding force that held us together.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_HumanClans_Content02=By the end of the War of Sorrow, we had become the Eastern Guardians, the "Itainen Vartmerkint." \n  Among the clans in the roll call of the Most Honored, we have cast our own names in the forges of War and Survival. Here stand some of those of deserved recognition:\n  The Blunts: A military family with a glorious past all the way up to the present.\n  The Ashdowns: An honorable family, true to the Snow Alliance.\n  The Sledges: A merchant family of great wealth and culture.\n  The Rivers: Faithful and brave.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_HumanClans_Content03=How many more will add their names to the list of the Most Honored? Only time will tell.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_NorthernClans_Title=The Pohjolen Vartmerkint
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_NorthernClans_Description=A short history of the Northern Guardians.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_NorthernClans_Content01=Ice and fire. When writing of the great houses of the Northern Guardians, it must be noted that life in the Great White is extreme, harsh, and demanding. Life, even for snow dwarves of the hardiest disposition, is too often cut short by adverse conditions and the many terrifyingly dangerous creatures that inhabit these snowy wastes. It is for this reason that those who make a life in the Great White stay loyal and true to friends, neighbors, and allies.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_NorthernClans_Content02=Such steadfast character creates many leaders and persons of great note, bravery, and wisdom; among them:\n  Hakki Goldheart - Clan chief of the Pohjolen Vartmerkint, killer of remorhaz\n  Glodi Strongheart - Brave warrior and battle leader\n  Jarnhilde Wisetongue - Warrior and representative of the Pohjolen\n  Hjalmar Whitecloud - storm giant friend, and killer of hill giants\n  The list is ever growing and illustrious.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Title=The Lantinen Vartmerkint
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Description=The Western Clans and Houses of the Snow Alliance.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content01=Dear reader, please find herein a brief record of the Lantinen Vartmerkint and its current main contributors. \n  We, the Lantinen, are a loose confederation of noble houses and clans that have existed for millennia, since before even the Snow Alliance. Many of our members, who founded the Western Guardians, are made up of the descendants of the high elves and sylvan elves that first fled the brutal tyranny of the Manacalon Empire several thousand years before the Cataclysm.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content02=Our self-reliant skills, hard-fought-for knowledge, and bravery have kept our lands, and latterly the lands of our allies in the Snow Alliance, free from oppression and evil since our first arrival. It is therefore with great pride that we acknowledge the deep regard in which we are held by our dwarven, gnomish, and recent human friends, and take great joy in calling them our friends. \n  Those that are held in highest regard are listed below:
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content03=Elder Estorgath Sharpmind - Eldest and wisest among us. Keeper of our Lore and Singer of Songs.\n  Kelariel Brightsong - Bard of the College of Hope\n  Esgariel Goldenhawk - Almost legendary, a lone Ranger of the Wilds. Esgariel has been unseen and unheard from in the last century. Some say she must be dead, but she has also been known to disappear for long periods several times in the last six hundred years.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content04=Lutharion Quicklimb - A Greenmage hermit who spends most of his time roaming the western Snow Alliance, giving aid to communities and eliminating monstrous threats…
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_ElvenClans_Content05=This book continues at length to detail the names and many locations of various noble houses and clans.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Title=The Snow Alliance: A History
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Description=How the Snow Alliance formed and the clans who forged it.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content01=In those early days of its foundation, our brave dwarvish houses each took responsibility for the defense of an entry point of the early settlements in the valleys and mines of White Rock. We called these alliances "Vartmerkint," which translates loosely from the old dwarvish as "Guardians of the Entries," each group competing to outdo all the others in feats of engineering and martial prowess. As our lands expanded, other new clans and Vartmerkint were formed as was necessary and practical.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content02=The history of the Snow Alliance is a many splendored tale of victory through millennia of hardships and adversity, forged in centuries of struggle and wars against the elements, the monstrous inhabitants of the region, the predations of the Manacalon Empire, the chaotic and catastrophic opening of the Rift, the equally traumatic Cataclysm, the War of Sorrow, and later wars.\n  The earliest Vartmerkint recorded were among the indigenous Snow Dwarves in and around Valkarokkopun (White Rock City).
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content03=Soon these "Vartmerkint" or "Guardians", by dwarvish tradition, were named after the points of the compass. \n  Namely: \n  the Eastern - "Itainen"\n  the Western - "Lantinen"\n  the Northern - "Pohjolen" \n  and the Southern Guardians - "Ettilen Vartmerkint". \n  Then there were the "deep dwarves" who guarded the mines and tunnels below the mountains, who became known as the Central Guardians - "Keskainen Vartmerkint"\n  And so were formed the leading clans we know to this day. But no land is impervious to change.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content04=Over time this group of clans became the Snow Alliance, but as the ravages of the wars with Manacalon, the Cataclysm, and the War of Sorrows took their toll, we were left no choice but to seek help from those that lived around us in the mountains, forests, and valleys. \n  First were the sylvan elves who had fled the first formation and expansion of the Manacalon Empire, settling in the western forests. Their cunning and bravery, uncomplaining, won them our trust and first entry to the Alliance.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content05=And then, after the near destruction of the first Lantinen in the Cataclysm, we passed that banner to them. \n  Next came the fall of the first Itainen, utterly destroyed in the War of Sorrows. The Snow Alliance was on its knees, but the humans that had come through the Rift never once shirked their duty; always guarding, always fighting, always working to help anyone in need. Using all of their alien knowledge and skills to keep the Alliance safe from any threat, becoming the second Itainen.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content06=And so the Snow Alliance now stands proud, all 200 clans, with five pre-eminent; the Itainen, Lantinen, Pohjolen, Ettilen, and Keskainen. These five are now known as the "Pact of the Claw," why the name…
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_SnowAlliance_Content07=Someone seems to have torn out a large number of pages here.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_MilitaryRanks_Title=Turvaamalinn Military Ranks
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_MilitaryRanks_Description=A brief discussion of dwarven military ranks.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_MilitaryRanks_Content01=The ranks of the army of Turvaamalinn are as solid and noble in character as the soldiers who stand in defense of the Undermountain. It is therefore of no great surprise that we organize and name those ranks according to the traditional dwarven assay values of metallic ores, and then combine those with the old dwarvish title "Jakar," meaning "Hunter" or "Warrior":\n  Thus the lowest ranking of our soldiers are known as "Pronsjakar" or "Bronze Hunters."
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_MilitaryRanks_Content02=next are the "Hopajakar" or "Silver Hunters," and then highest ranked, the "Kultajakar" or "Gold Hunters." \n  If the Kultajakar are committed to a battle, then the danger to the Undermountain is great and the fight most perilous. Thus, when a member of the Keskainen Vartmerkint says, "We are down to the Kultajakar," they mean that the situation is desperate.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_Tale_Title=The Abominable Terror of the Peaks
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_Tale_Description=A frightening dwarven children's tale of morality.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_Tale_Content01=Once upon a time, there were two very naughty children, Hegri and Gurda Blacknose. They were so naughty, they didn't listen to their elders and pulled the beards of old dwarves. \n  One day, Hegri and Gurda decided to go on an adventure and leave the village without telling anyone. They packed their rucksacks with snacks, and filled their drinking skins with small beer. Oh, what naughty children they were!\n  It started to snow heavily, and the children were soon lost. Noises and shapes followed them.
Equipment/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lore_Tale_Content02=If Hegri and Gurda had listened to their parents, then they would have known that being out in a snowstorm was a terrible idea. Because that is when Peak Terrors and Peak Abominations hunt. Huge, awful creatures who love nothing more than eating a naughty dwarven child for their dinner. \n  Hegri and Gurda screamed, as hurtling out of the Great White came monsters with white fur and gnashing teeth. Dropping their rucksacks, they ran, but it was too late!\n  Poor Hegri and Gurda were never seen again.\n  The End
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Title=The Schism
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Description=An exploration of the true origins of the sylvan elves.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Content01=If the histories of the Manacalon Empire are true, and without fault, then all elves in the most ancient of times were once high elves, without exception. It is said it was the foundation of the Manacalon Empire and their strict and brutal imposition of order on all elves that brought about the change that begat the sylvan elves. The tone and inconsistency in the details of such histories does, however, leave much room for doubt, as does the earliest oral histories of the Coedymwarth.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Content02=It is the comparative lack of written accounts from the earliest days of the Coedymwarth rebellion, and the remarkably "on message" surviving accounts written by the high elves that makes any determination of the exact truth so difficult. Among the most ancient of the oral histories, the sylvan elves often talk of having been "borne from the Woodes and Wealdes of the Worlde." And yet the Manacalon Empire universally dismisses such claims as "most false and without merit."
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Content03=Why such dogmatic insistence by the Manacalon Empire and the high elves, the former masters? Why are sylvan elves so recognizably culturally distinct in their mindset and their society? Why are the sylvan elves so unlike the many other high elves who also rebelled and left the Empire at the same time as the sylvan elves of the Coedymwarth? Thus, the time of separation between the two does not sufficiently explain this divergence.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_TheSchism_Content04=Could the divergence of elvenkind have begun long before the Coedymwarth? Is there a germ of truth in the idea that the affinity for wood and woodland living had already created a fundamental separation among elvenkind? The similarity between the two branches says that a common ancestry is true, but that does not mean the high elves were first. Could that be the reason for the Coedymwarth rebellion? The high elves imposing their version of the truth on their cousins as well as all other species?
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Title=Notes on a New Bloodline
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Description=A scrap from a draconic diary talking of the dragonborn.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Content01=Tanan, 25th day.\n  The last two centuries have been hard. The works I have spent so much effort to create have all failed to bear fruit. So it is with joy, and some astonishment, that I have found myself with child by my lover, Lutharion… \n  \n  Tandwyn, 16th day.\n  Our joy has turned to shock. The child, she is a dragonborn! How is this possible? Lutharion has no dragon blood. I was assured by Cleira that this couldn't happen. But it has. Beautiful as she is, Dorcas is no elf. Still, my love cares not…
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Content02=Aeardair, 8th day.\n  I have gone into hiding with Dorcas. Too many react in a way that pierces my heart. She grows fast. Unlike her father, her limbs are powerful and her scales beautiful and dark, shining like obsidian. But she has no look of an elf, other than her bipedal form…
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Content03=Many pages are water-soaked, the ink has bled through the pages, and many have stuck together.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_Dragons_Content04=Isgeun, 12th day. \n  Dorcas, faithful to a fault, is invaluable, reinvigorating me, instrumental in my escape from those who chase us from each home. We flee ever north, hoping to find others like ourselves.\n  How could I know how important my dear dragonborn would become in the dark days that have come, fleeing ever northwards, always seeking safety, now in disguised refuge among the clans of the Snow Alliance. Maybe here we shall know some peace, among folk more accepting of difference…

Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_DayliLife_Description=Parchment letter from before the Cataclysm.
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_DayliLife_Content01=Dearest Edfalyad,\n  How is your lovely partner Lythyrial? Have you found a place for your new loom yet? \n  Forgive me, I suppose I really should come to the point of my writing this letter. \n  Today we decided that the dark disease they call the Manacalon Empire has been getting too close. Colthannin has become crowded with refugees, and my dearest Khaly's soul wearies at the constant influx of strangers always talking of war. It is for this reason I have arranged for us to travel north…
Equipment/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Lore_DayliLife_Content02=…to a land where our people and snow dwarves are said to meet as equals, a place of unrivaled, stark beauty, freedom, and opportunity. \n  The people of this land call themselves the Snow Alliance, and our people have a place there, I think it is called Lantinen. \n  If it doesn't work out? Well, we can always come back to Dunannon through the Sylvan Step gates.\n  Sorry to be so brief, but my heart aches to leave you both here.\n  Yours with love,\n  Miruthdrel Lightsong

Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Description=The Wars before the Three Century Pact.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Content01=This ancient and crumbling tome appears to be centuries old. Many pages crumble to dust on contact or have faded beyond legibility.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Content02=To comprehend the Three Century Pact and its benefits for the Eastern Kingdoms, it is important to understand the almost constant state of internecine and national wars that preceded it. In this tome, I will attempt to discuss the why, the who, and the where - and sometimes the how.\n  First, we need to know the major players in this series of conflicts: \n  The Principality of Masgarth, the Kingdom of Gallivan, the New Empire, the Snow Alliance, and the Kingdom of Colthannin.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Content03=After the Cataclysm, the world was in chaos and bereft of mana, and few could see a time when there would be any normality. It was this event that led to the rise the major powers that we see today. Each of the previously mentioned states vying to carve a niche for the survival of their people, soon bringing them into conflict with each other. \n  It was during this conflict that Masgarth lost three of its nine duchies, but unified into a Principality under the reign of Galoreth Silverflower, and…
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_ThreeCenturyPact_Content04=the borders of Colthannin and Gallivan settled on the island of Rivermeet. \n  It was in the formulation of this same pact that the territorial integrity of the Snow Alliance was finally recognized, and the New Empire undertook to cease its attempts at wars of conquest to its north and east. \n  Although it is tempting to see these borders as being the natural state of affairs, the truth is that they fluctuated significantly in the preceding centuries of conflict, with…

I think she's simply ambitious and arrogant. Nevertheless, she is a talented and efficient soldier. However, she should be leading her own company instead of jostling with competitors, especially when we need unity above all else.\n  Second Lieutenant Zarmir Ortus is a wildcard. Great fighter, but unreliable. He's a drinker, a hedonist, and not a soldier at heart. Let's just say he's good for the battlefield but bad for bootcamp.\n  Lord Synatir is both soft and arrogant, he likely earned his rank through nepotism.\n  Warrant Officer Jaden Greyhouse: He's soft, his head is back home with his fiancée, not focused here on the front.\n  Lance Corporal Hillsborough: So far unremarkable.

Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_Lore_AbyssalAgitator_Title=Notes on an Abyssal Agitator by Exonaïka
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_Lore_AbyssalAgitator_Description=A description of how to construct and operate an Abyssal Agitator, written in elvish.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_Lore_AbyssalAgitator_Content01=An unintended boon discovered in my myriad battles with the demon-kind has been that the essences of their spirit and mana are often left behind as a residue. This essence takes the form of a foul and viscous substance when the host is killed.\n  After much experimentation, I have been able to create a variety of worthy and useful unguents wrought from foul origins. Useful - if the user can put up with the noxious fumes generated by their application.
Equipment/&DLC3_Telema_Lore_AbyssalAgitator_Content02=To achieve creation of the necessary mixing device, which I now call an "Abyssal Agitator," carefully follow my instructions herein. It is but a simple matter to assemble using a crafting tool, if you know how. \n  Once the Abyssal Agitator is complete, it is possible to begin the mixing of the indicated ingredients to create a variety of applications. I have decided to call these substances "demonic grease." \n  Please refer to the appended list of recipes that I have included herein.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Title=Gnomes
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Description=Some observations from Antiquarians.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Content01=There is much mystery to the origins of gnomes. Which stories are to be believed is a question oft debated since they first emerged above ground after the Cataclysm. Are they a native species to Solasta, or did they come through the Rift? Did they exist on Ferendragh at the dawn of Solasta's history? Are they a magically created species, or their own unique people? \n  Who truly knows? The gnomes themselves are always evasive on the subject when pressed too hard by outsiders.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Content02=Among many common tales gnomes have been heard to tell others, the most common include: \n  "We dug our way here from a world underneath Solasta and caused the Rift. So we hid to avoid taking the blame."\n  "We created a time travel machine which exploded, and we lost all our memories and language. The dwarves and halflings taught us to read and write again." \n  "Millennia ago, deep under Ferendragh, strange beings ate strange mushrooms. Out of this quite unique diet came the gnomes."
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Gnomes_Content03=Whatever the truth may be, we do know that gnomes are not as tall as halflings nor as tall or as broad as dwarves. Their quite unique tongue appears to have many words with roots in ancient dwarven, and uses dwarven runes when written. They are well-suited to living under ground, being able to see well in poor light. They are often reclusive, smart, and have an amazing talent for tinkering, a knack for cunning and humor, and a flexible approach to honor and morality.

Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Tieflings_Content01=After much research, it is now known that tieflings are not, as had previously been rumored, from the Western Kingdoms or from another continent. After much effort and at great expense, we finally managed to get a group of tieflings to agree to be interviewed. How much of what they said is true is up for debate. Until we can unearth more evidence, the following is as good as we can get:\n  The first tieflings were from Tirmar, and they entered Solasta through the Rift.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Tieflings_Content02=They were enemies of the Sorr-Akkath even before they entered Solasta. Their legends speak of an infernal curse on the peoples, family, and descendants of a Priest of Pakri, named Eikon.\n  Eikon's bargain with a devil-prince had been made in order to save their kingdom and to also be immune to the control of Soraks, but that bargain came at a terrible price, an infernal taint, a curse that produced the tieflings. The bargain failed to save their kingdom, forcing them to flee through the Rift.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Tieflings_Content03=In the centuries since the Cataclysm and the closing of the Rift, the tieflings have had to live in hard-to-reach places, hiding in the darkest dens beneath cities, and in wild, out-of-the-way places. Always outsiders, treated with great suspicion by native Solastans and humans alike. Some say that lack of faith is deserved, and that no creature that has an infernal taint can be fully trusted. We shall let the reader decide the truth of that.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Title=The Eulalia
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Description=A brief account of its history and construction.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Content01=The Eulalia, more commonly known as the "Song Speaker of White Rock City," was first built in the third century after the Cataclysm by the legendary dwarven smith Storri Brighthearth, and his friend, the elven bard Veralia Lyralyn. \n  The Eulalia was intended not only to create a visually appealing focal point for the city, but also as an instrument that could be used as a means of weather prediction, emergency alarm, citywide communication, and occasional entertainment for the city's citizens.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Content02=When correctly played by trained operators, the Eulalia has multiple uses, and can create a variety of warning siren notes to alert the city and its defenders to imminent dangers to the city. It can also call out prearranged signals that can be heard throughout the city and its caverns, and thus coordinates the city in times of emergency. On feast days and special occasions, the Eulalia can also be played by skilled bards to create beautiful and rousing music that entertains the city.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_Eulalia_Content03=When not used as an instrument in this way, the air ducts that feed to it from the outside naturally respond audibly to changes in airflow and air pressure, and thus create a harmonic and accurate barometer of the prevailing weather conditions outside the city, as well as an alert for changes of air quality in the deep mines and caverns below.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Title=The Keskainen Vartmerkint
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Description=A book about the peoples of the Undermountain.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Content01=Rock and furnace, vein and ore. The people of the Undermountain are the foundation on which the Snow Alliance is built. Dwarves true of purpose and strong of arm. The unseen bulwark against the tides of evil that besiege the Snow Alliance. Our metal ores fuel the forges that create our wealth, and the armor and weapons we use to fight. The rocks we quarry maintain and build the walls that protect the nation. Without the Keskainen Vartmerkint, the Snow Alliance would collapse.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Content02=Outsiders say that we deep dwarves should open up to the world, but what do outsiders know of our ways or of our people? We are the anvil of dwarven creation! \n  Find here our list of those most honored. Names to be carved on the Stone Tablets for all eternity:\n  Brokir Steelheart, Leader of House Perlevinn, Chieftain of the Steelheart Clan. Wise and stout of heart.\n  Baldi Boldhand, Leader of House Ettiven, Chieftain of the Boldhand Clan. Brave and bold in nature and in name.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_KeskainenVartmerkint_Content03=Gunna Wisehead, Electoral Overseer of the Keskainen. Honest and true to the clans of the Undermountain.\n  Hakki Strongspine, famed Kultajakar who slaughtered two Peak Terrors with just two sweeps of his axe.\n  Magda Strongstone, honored representative of Turvaamalinn to White Rock City.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Title=The Court of Knives
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Description=A journal describing political intrigues in Gallivan.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Content01=Dearest brother,\n  As you know, a war with the Snow Alliance grows ever more likely, and the continuing paranoia and intrigues at court grow ever more bizarre. For my safety, I write this journal in the hope that I might get it to you without detection.\n  Jornalas is becoming ever more erratic. It is as though he is a different man. His raging outbursts now silence any who offer an opinion or advice on any matter. His new advisors support him in this and surround him, controlling access to his presence.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Content02=Queen Lucilla and her entourage have not been seen at court for weeks, and are said to be ensconced in the Royal Apartments outside the city. None are allowed to communicate directly to her, and the families of her entourage are nowhere to be found. \n  Meanwhile, Edwor Strongheart has vanished after another vocal confrontation with his father. Officially, Edwor has gone "to survey troop deployments" in the deep forests to the east, "in order to counter a possible threat from Colthannin."
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Content03=After another one of his increasingly common confrontations with the King's advisors, Lord Bryden Sledge was dragged away in disgrace. Allegedly, he was plotting to sell out the kingdom to the Soraks. Any who know Bryden know that although money is a strong motivator, his immense wealth and family ties precludes the possibility of him wanting to sell us out in such a way. He is currently held in the castle dungeons, and King Jornalas refuses to let anyone speak to him.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_CourtOfKnives_Content04=I must end this journal here and send it with my trusted batman Sturges. I have been told to prepare for a visit by the King's retinue, and must entertain them. They arrive soon. I hope they do not suspect me of anything.\n  With abiding affection, your true and loyal brother,\n  R.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Title=Gallivan on the March
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Description=A letter in response to the intrigues at court.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Content01=My brother,\n  I hope this letter will find you both well and whole. It is with great distress that I read of the goings-on at court. Perhaps desperate times call for desperate measures?\n  I too feel it is only a matter of time before the horns of war are blown to the borders here in the north. Although I have at no point found any solid evidence of the Snow Alliance seeking to make incursions on our own lands borders, I have seen military activity on the Snow Alliance side.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Content02=This activity suggests that maybe the Snow Alliance is preparing for a war. \n  We must remember that dwarves and elves are creatures unlike humans, creatures that we cannot fully trust. They see this world and humans differently. Living as long as they do makes them unable to understand who we are, or why we do what we do. This may be why the King acts as he does. Perhaps he is in possession of secret knowledge we cannot fathom. Perhaps the Soraks have infiltrated the Snow Alliance.
Equipment/&DLC3_Gallivan_Lore_GallivanOnTheMarch_Content03=Whatever the truth, I have sworn an eternal oath of duty to the Kingdom of Gallivan, and as such, to its true and rightful king. I am already commanded with raising troops, equipment, and supplies "for actions to repel Snow Alliance aggression." Such actions worry me, but I cannot shirk my duty. We march for the borders and commence construction of watchtowers and fortifications at the soonest instance.\n  Your true and loyal brother,\n  F.

Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_TrappersFamily_Content01=My dear friends,\n  \n  I cannot thank you enough for saving me and my son from certain death. I grieve every moment for Snorri, and I know he would be grateful for what you did for our family.\n  I am sure you would have gotten along with him.\n  \n  Please accept this as a token of my gratitude. We fished it out a few days ago, but I have a strong feeling that this will be more useful to you than to me.\n  May our paths cross again one day.\n  \n  Helga

Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_GeneralBlunt_Content01=Thank you again for your help. I knew I could trust you. You made the right choice. Our army cannot afford to host traitors.\n  \n  Take this as a token of my appreciation. It is a piece of armor that I recovered from the corpse of a Gallivan general a few weeks ago, but I didn't really know what to do with it.\n  I hope it will be useful to you in your quest.\n  \n  General Blunt
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_CaptainAshdown_Title=Letter from Captain Ashdown
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_CaptainAshdown_Description=A note written by Captain Ashdown.
Equipment/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Lore_CaptainAshdown_Content01=Thank you again for your help. I knew I could trust you. You made the right choice. Our army really needed a renewal if we ever want to win this war.\n  \n  Take this as a token of my appreciation. It is a piece of armor that I recovered from the corpse of a Gallivan general a few weeks ago, but I didn't really know what to do with it.\n  I hope it will be useful to you in your quest.\n  \n  Captain Ashdown
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Title=Letter from Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Description=As promised, you and Marshal Sunblaze exchange letters to keep informed of the situation in the Snow Alliance and in the Principality. Somehow, his letters always seem to find you.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content01=Dear friends, I heard about the tragic events at Kaupaapunki. I am glad, though, that you were able to find Lord Kaikonnen's murderer and cleanse the city of Sorak infiltrators. It confirms that our enemy is also deeply established in the Snow Alliance. News from the front is not good: the forces of the Principality are barely sustaining the advance of Gallivan troops.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content01b=On the upside, the New Empire is not using the opportunity to attack from the south. Even they are not blind enough to help the Sorr-Akkath destroy us. I wish you the best in your endeavors. Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content01c=On the upside, the New Empire is not using the opportunity to attack from the south. Even they are not blind enough to help the Sorr-Akkath destroy us. I wish you the best in your endeavors. Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content02=Dear friends, I was surprised to hear from Master Goodcheer on your behalf. She told me you were tracking demons, which is a worrying prospect. The thought that Sorr-Akkath and demons could be working together keeps me up at night. On the bright side, the troops of the Principality won a decisive battle on the front.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content02b=I'm afraid this might push our enemy to move its troops northwards and cause more trouble for the Snow Alliance. Good luck with your research. Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content03=Dear friends, I received word from Commander Miles at Highrock Outpost. He tells me you unraveled a Sorak network that linked a scavenger quartermaster named Hector to an infiltrator among his men.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content03b=That means that despite their massive attack against Caer Cyflen, the Sorr-Akkath still have sleeping agents all over the Eastern Kingdoms.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content03c=Keep up the good work. Every operation that we reveal is another blow to their evil plans. \n  Einar guide you!\n  \n  Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content04=Dear friends, I received word of the events on the frontline between Gallivan and the Snow Alliance. I met with General Blunt but not with Captain Ashdown. I'm sorry things had to turn the way they did, but I trust your make the right choice. What matters is that you obtained the support of the Itainen Vartmerkint.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content04b=I'm also glad of all the damage you dealt to the Sorr-Akkath pawns in the armies of Gallivan. \n  We still have strong suspicions that the royal family there has been replaced, and no idea of where the real King, Jornalas IV, is being held prisoner. \n  Stay in the light! Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content05=Dear friends, I heard about your adventures in the elven settlements of the Snow Alliance. \n  Again, you found Soraks infiltrating influential people, with elaborated plots to manipulate our allies. \n  I do hope your investigations into the demon threat is progressing well.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content05b=On our side, we had a military drawback in the south: a company of mercenaries hit our troops by surprise, but this does reveal that Gallivan is having difficulties mustering more of their own. \n  \n  We lost a battle, not the war. Stay in the light! Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content06=Dear friends, our common friend Galar Goldentongue informed me of the events in Turvaamalinn. Once again, you prevented the Sorr-Akkath from meddling in the internal politics of the Snow Alliance. The troops of the Principality earned a great victory on the frontline recently when a company of Spellblades, led by Lord Danantar himself, unleashed havoc on a strategic location on the border.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content06b=Some of the officers were Sorr-Akkath infiltrators, you won't be surprised to hear. Continue the good work. Einar guide you.\n  \n  Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content07=Dear friends, I received word that you have traveled to the far north of the Alliance with my old friend Marduk Strongheart. Yes, he became a Paladin of Einar the same year I did, and we used to be close. \n  \n  Knowing him, I suppose this was an adventurous expedition, and I'm glad you were with him. I hope his clan recovers from the tragic events that have befallen them.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content07b=On the bright side, I have news that you'll be happy to hear: our common acquaintance, Lord Faisech, has requested diplomatic immunity. \n  He isn't a Sorr-Akkath in disguise, but as I thought, simply a despicable human being. \n  \n  Good luck, and stay in the light. Marshal Beric Sunblaze
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content08=Dear friends, Master Gorm sent me a message explaining your situation. \n  What you're about to accomplish is even more dreadful than taking a Major Gate to the Aer Elai. \n  I know little of demons, but enough to recommend that you arm yourselves with weapons other than those that use fire or cold, and to protect yourselves against those elements, as they as the favorites of this Sessroth and his goons.
Equipment/&DLC3_Document_BericLetter_Content08b=Also remember that demons cannot die unless killed on their own plane of existence. \n  \n  I hope you find a way to stop this threat once and for all. Einar guide you. Marshal Beric Sunblaze

Faction/&ItemsScroll03_Title=Farewell Letter
Faction/&ItemsScroll03_Title2=A rolled, sealed letter in a leather case.
Faction/&ItemsScroll04_Description=Tomaz,\n \n I do hope these words find you in good health, and I am sorry for not writing sooner. Requisitioning the necessary supplies, and ensuring delivery is risky, and dangerous. But it is well worth it, as your letters have become a shining beacon of hope in the dark nights that haunt this prison.\n\n Your words of concern are not misplaced, as the wound of old is spreading my certain end through my feverish body. Days of labor are more torturous than the last, every disciplinary action leaving wounds that will never heal, and hunger has thinned the veil between reality and dream. I fear this letter may be my last.\n \n Long ago you asked me what crimes lead me here, and I professed my innocence. I could not risk that my beloved thought any less of me. Your worship of my fortitude, determination, and spirit allowed you to draw strength in dark times. I could not allow that to be tainted by my past. But now, in these final days, I understand that I was hardly worthy of that affection. I will never fathom how I deserved meeting you in this crucible of my own making.\n \n When I was young my mother's farm had fallen on hard times. I was sent to the Lady's estate to work as a maid amongst deranged aristocrats. These years were filled with mischievous pranks, brute discipline, and cruel indignities. All of my scars and faults tell of those years. The Lady never burdened herself with guilt, but put the blame solely on the shoulders of my mother. Repressed longings turned into despair, despair into resentment, and resentment into spite, which culminated into a hate-filled second of violence my mother did not survive.\n \n And despite my faults, lies, and my shameful past, you still loved me. I did not fully understand why until the end. You did not need to know my past, for your love is unconditional.\n\n Please, my love, do not look at the past, but to the future. Do not fall for despair as I once did, but let the child birthed of our love carry you to a new beginning.\n \n Merilyn
Faction/&ItemsScroll04_Title=Tragic Love Letter
Faction/&ItemsScroll04_Title2=A letter, written in haste on a torn-out scrap of paper.
Faction/&ItemsScroll05_Description=I, Nilocyrel Dream-Minder, hereby bear witness of the miracle of light.\n\n As part of a conclave of mages focused on the research of magic and accompanied by the always interfering Imperial agents we were to investigate rumors of the sudden appearance of a seemingly magical construct of light deep in an uninhabited region of Aer-Elai. While fast-traveling through still civilized areas of the Empire, we took notice of strange rumors that had started to spread.\n \n Sightings of creatures, burly as dwarves but almost as tall as the Sitherna itself. Clad in pelts and iron, aggressive and savage. At first we thought some children were exaggerating their encounter with the lonely remains of some scattered dwarves, but later on we were able to study a captive, while resting in a rural outpost. Its stature and surly look were comparable with the dwarves from the northern mountains, if it weren't for the obvious difference in size.\n \n Judging by the still wrinkle-free face it was most likely a youngling and seemed to be able to speak, but neither I nor my more traveled companions could make any sense of the guttural sounds it would utter. My colleague Andariel Silvertongue muses if it would be possible to use magic to understand these barbaric humanoids, but we didn't have time to further research this topic. Maybe our misguided brethren in the east might know more about this kin.\n \n Four days after we left the seat of the Arcaneum, while the darkness of the approaching night started to set in, we finally caught a glimpse of the incident we were tasked to research. I saw the sky burn with cold, otherworldly flames, which were of a kind neither of us had laid its eyes upon before.\n \n It is too dark to continue and while a sight to behold, I sense a feeling of dread coming from this light. I entrust this interim report to an accompanying agent, who will travel back this night to report the coordinates this magical construct can be found at. Tomorrow we will advance further.

Faction/&ItemsScroll06_Description=His name was Thuriel Duskfall.\n A childhood disease left him deaf and disfigured.\nHe found his sole pleasure in life from fishing in the streams at night. Silent and at peace, he was not judged when alone and in the dark. Thus, he developed a skill that gave him value in the eyes of the sylvan elves, who otherwise viewed him as imperfect and damaged.\n He was also my brother.\nI covered his body with a cairn of stones on the riverbank where I found it.\n They had taken his rod and his fish, the bracelet he had from our father, his fileting knife, everything.\n So I tracked them. They were many, and arrogant, but I had little else to do, and all the time in the world.\n Four died before they learned to leave guards at night.\n Two more before they learned to make sure the guards were sober.\n Six of them slept together in a tent; I slit the throats of the three largest and left the rest to their sweet dreams.\n By the time they made Port Harrow they were telling stories of the hordes of night witches who descended upon them from the haunted boughs of Colthannin, drinking the blood of their friends and depopulating entire villages.\n More died there, where they mistakenly believed the crowds would give them safety.\n An envoy from my people came, asking me to stop. I indicated that I would do so the day my brother came back to life.\n I have not done so.\n Stranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, I ask that you leave it be, and say a prayer for the soul of my brother.\n Stranger, if you find this scroll, by the cairn by the river, and disturb the cairn, or take the scroll, know that I will find you.\n They call me Nightplague.

Legal/&KickstarterDemoDisclaimerDescription=IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: YOU are aware that what you intend to download and play is a very early PRE-ALPHA DEMO of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game which is still under development. Be sure that OUR team is currently working hard to bring the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game to a whole new level. The PRE-ALPHA DEMO is made available for free for a limited period of time only. \n \n The PRE-ALPHA DEMO is hand-crafted to give YOU an early taste of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game; the PRE-ALPHA DEMO may contain bugs on rare occasions. YOU are more than welcome to share your feedback and report any problems or bugs on the Steam platform or directly on OUR website www.solasta-game.com. WE need to hear from YOU in order to make a game that is representative of what our community wants.\n \n Some rules and features are missing or are not implemented in the PRE-ALPHA DEMO. For example, the surprise round is not implemented, readying an action is not yet possible, we are too liberal at swapping inventory items, and some spells and effects are missing. We will fix this and try our best to integrate as much content and as many rules as possible for the final game. Some of the game features are also not demonstrated at all in the PRE-ALPHA DEMO but will be part of the final game: creating and leveling up a full party with a wide range of options, playing through a campaign storyline, and much more.

Legal/&EarlyAccessDisclaimerDescription=Hey there folks! Welcome to Solasta - or more specifically, the Early Access of Solasta: Crown of the Magister. We really appreciate your support. You're all fantastic!\n \n Please bear in mind that you are playing an Early Access version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister which is still under development. This Early Access version contains around 10 hours of gameplay and gives you access to the full Character Creation Tool with all ancestries, classes, and archetypes unlocked, with a level cap at level 6. The full 1.0 release will see a price increase and will deliver the entire main campaign of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, as well as many side quests for you to discover. \n\n We have done our best to provide a strong and enjoyable experience. However, do note that the Early Access version may contain some occasional bugs. You are warmly invited to send us feedback, report any bugs and problems, or suggest improvements on our Discord server (https://discord.com/invite/uu8utaF) as well on our official forums (https://forums.solasta-game.com/). Our goal is to continue working hand in hand with our players to make a game that is representative of what our community wants. Be sure that our team is currently working hard to release the full version of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game that will include lots of additional features and content. \n\n Considering the fact that game development is a very iterative process, please understand that your save files on the Early Access version will likely be incompatible with larger updates and with the full game release. As such, if you are looking for the complete experience the full version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister can offer, we encourage you not to purchase this Early Access version, but to wait for the release of the full game. Alright, enough reading - go enjoy the game!

Marketing/&DisclaimerSteamFestivalDescription=You are aware that what you intend to play is a very early Alpha Demo of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game, which is still under development. Be sure that our team is currently working hard to bring Solasta: Crown of the Magister to a whole new level. We are also working on providing you with a fully working Character Creator, allowing you to create and level up a full party with an even wider range of options. The Early Alpha Demo is available for free for a limited period of time only. \n \n The Early Alpha Demo is hand-crafted to give you an early taste of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game, it may contain bugs on rare occasions. You are more than welcome to share your feedback and report any problems or bugs on the Steam platform or directly on our website www.solasta-game.com. We need to hear from you in order to make a game that is representative of what our community wants.\n\n Some rules and features are missing or are not implemented in the Early Alpha Demo. For example, some spells and effects are missing. The Early Alpha Demo allows you to create a full party of characters using the Character Creator tool, but it will not breathe life into your heroes yet. We will of course fix this and try our best to integrate as much content and rules as possible for the final game. Some of the game features are also not demonstrated at all in the Early Alpha Demo, but will be part of the final game: leveling up a full party created with a wide range of options, playing through a campaign storyline, and much more.

Narration/&NecromancyTextObj23=A strange-looking symbol, probably mystical.
Narration/&NecromancyTextObj24=A rune or glyph of some unknown type.
Narration/&NecromancyTextObj25=A mystical symbol, possibly inactive.
Narration/&NecromancyTextObj26=What's wrong with all these mirrors?
Narration/&NecromancyTextObj27=A very odd painting.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_01=The bridge is closed for now.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_02=The Council is in the opposite direction.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_01=There's trouble on the road. Please remain in town for now.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_02=Please stay in the high town for now.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MaddyGreenisle01=Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_AnnieBagmordah01=We'll talk after your swearing-in.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_AnnieBagmordah02=I'll be with you in a minute.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HugoRequer01=Let's get you deputized, first, shall we?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HugoRequer02=I'm in the middle of something - sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_GorimIronsoot01=Lord Carran said not to bother you… yet.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_GorimIronsoot02=Come back later. I'm busy with the accounts.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_KarelMartel=Lord Carran said no more beer… sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark01=I'm busy. Come back later.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark02=Oh, it's you. Well, I'm still busy. Thank you for your service.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark03=Look who's here - Caer Cyflen's rising stars!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark04=Council business is not my business. Be on your way.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_MayorBrightSpark05=We knew this war was looming. We'll prevail, as always.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton01=Go get killed in the Badlands…
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton02=You were still filling your diapers when I killed my first ghoul…
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton03=I heard your stories. Not impressive.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton04=I know everyone in this city… and everyone knows me.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton05=You're still here? I'm sure there are some rats to kill in some cave somewhere.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton06=I know that look. Something happened… something bad.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton07=Don't get too cocky. These Soraks have more tricks up their sleeves.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton08=That crown's a trouble magnet, I can tell.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton09=Still alive? Good. There's more cleaning up to do.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton10=I'm better, sure. Doesn't mean I can't have a couple of beers…
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton11=Well, I handled some unfinished business… feels good. I'm celebrating.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton12=If you're looking for a sharp blade… I'm your man.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_ArwinMerton13=Any time, friends… I mean, any time after I finish this beer.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant01=I'm busy. Go see Galar.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant02=We're packing - sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant03=You want to buy something, ask Galar.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaravanMerchant04=No time to chat - sorry!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard01=Keep out, strangers!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CoparannKeepGuard02=The Baron's waiting for you.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CaptainIronshell01=Stay in the light, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyPCSpeech_TowerOfMagicJammedDoor=This door is blocked… magically?
Narration/&Banter_Generic_01=Something's off.
Narration/&Banter_Generic_02=We should search the area carefully.
Narration/&Banter_Generic_03=Look at this place!
Narration/&Banter_Generic_04=Doesn't make any sense…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_01=Where did those goblins come from?
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_02=Some hole in the mountain, I guess.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_03=What's that smell?
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_04=Damn, it stinks…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_05=I wouldn't sleep here.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_06=The Soraks can't be far away.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_07=We need to rest if we want to stand a chance against them.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_08=This place is so dark…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_09=That was fun.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_10=That was a long shot.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_11=We were so close.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_01=I can't believe Lisbath stayed behind…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_02=We're all gonna die…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Beryl_03=I'll have to tell the captain's wife.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_01=We should have left long ago…
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_02=Leadership is what we need now.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Lisbath_03=They won't get me without a fight.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_01=Up to my knees in the mud, nothing new here.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_02=Shit food, shit shoes, business as usual.
Narration/&Banter_Caerlem_Robar_03=If we survive this I might drink myself to death.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_01=This place doesn't make any sense.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_02=In the Badlands… blah, blah…
Narration/&Banter_ToM_03=What happens if you fall down there?
Narration/&Banter_ToM_04=Wanna try?
Narration/&Banter_ToM_05=All these books floating around and I can't grab them.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_06=Are those webs?
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_01=Welcome, deputies!
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_02=Your rooms are ready.
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_03=Good day, senior deputies.
Narration/&Banter_ButlerRavensworth_04=Clear skies… as they say!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_01=This place is so… wet.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_02=Feels like everything's dead around here…
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_03=Well, it's dark, but at least it's not sewers anymore.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_04=Stay on your guard! We weren't invited here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_05=What's in all those bottles?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_06=I wouldn't set them on fire just to find out.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_07=Smells like death.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_08=Is that a… pile of corpses? Gross!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_09=Someone here doesn't like the light of day.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_10=What kind of castle is that?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_11=Someone transformed it into a maze.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_12=Someone paranoid, you mean?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_13=We're going to die here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_14=There must a way be out.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_15=Look for hints!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_16=It lost its mana, that's all.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_17=These arrows, they're not just random.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_18=Something's changed here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_19=That cannot be opened from here.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_20=There must be a mechanism somewhere.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_21=I heard a mechanism.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_22=That opened something.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_23=This guy made it this far… maybe he found a hint.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_24=Another victim of the maze…
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_25=Tell me we're not going back in there…
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_26=So, no rune activated on that teleporter.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_27=I guess we need to reset the teleporter.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_28=I think we took a wrong turn.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_29=Hmm… four slabs for the four of us?
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_30=And… no rune on that teleporter, either.
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_31=I think this slab has triggered something!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_32=I heard some kind of mechanism!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_Talbut=Keep away from my home, strangers!
Narration/&Banter_BoneKeep_Anbgi=Where's that damn femur?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_01=She's crazy…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_02=Shouldn't we go to Coparann?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_01=My beautiful river… broken and stained…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_02=The pull, the pull…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_03=Master, I'm coming!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_04=Are there dwarf kings now? Halfling kings too, maybe?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_05=That sounds… wrong.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_06=No slaves, no Gates…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_07=…this travel is exhausting.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_08=Humans don't look that bad.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_09=They smell a bit, though…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_10=This… town is really dirty.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_11=Is this Baron really a dwarf?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_12=I can't call a dwarf my lord, can I?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_13=He's rude. But he is a dwarf, after all.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_14=He is a nice dwarf.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Kythaela_15=A halfling merchant? I almost didn't see him.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_01=Nice gardens.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_02=This place is magnificent.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_03=I never thought I'd get so close to the embassies.
Narration/&Banter_Cyflen_04=That's a view!
Narration/&LoreTrailer01=Before the Cataclysm, there were no gods on Solasta.
Narration/&LoreTrailer02=No humans, either.
Narration/&LoreTrailer03=Then the Rift opened.
Narration/&LoreTrailer04=Some say it was a magical accident…
Narration/&LoreTrailer05=…or the work of an evil god.
Narration/&LoreTrailer06=No one knows for sure.
Narration/&LoreTrailer07=The Cataclysm destroyed the old High Elf empire
Narration/&LoreTrailer08=- Manacalon, they called it -
Narration/&LoreTrailer09=and twisted the land beyond recognition.
Narration/&LoreTrailer10=Now, only the brave and the foolish go there, in search of ancient treasures.
Narration/&LoreTrailer11=But something is happening, deep in those Badlands.
Narration/&LoreTrailer12=Whatever it is,
Narration/&LoreTrailer13=it can't be good.
Narration/&TelemaArrivingTitle=Entering Telema
Narration/&Telema_1_Entrance_Fighter=So, these are the ruins of Telema?
Narration/&Telema_2_Entrance_Wizard=Just as the chronicles describe them!
Narration/&Telema_3_Entrance_Wizard=Imagine the wonders that await us inside!
Narration/&Telema_4_Entrance_Cleric=Don't forget… we're here to help the Scavengers.
Narration/&Telema_5_Entrance_Rogue=And get rich, right?
Narration/&Telema_6_Entrance_Rogue=Help the Scavengers and get rich.
Narration/&Telema_7_Entrance_Fighter=You're all heart, aren't you?
Narration/&Telema_8_Entrance_Cleric=That must be their camp over there.
Narration/&Telema_9_Entrance_Cleric=Come on, let's go.
Narration/&TelemaMeetingScavsTitle=The Scavengers' Camp
Narration/&Telema_10_MeetingScavs_Lena=Who goes there?
Narration/&Telema_11_MeetingScavs_Fighter=Friends!
Narration/&Telema_12_MeetingScavs_Cleric=Runnel sent us.
Narration/&Telema_13_MeetingScavs_Dek=Where is he?
Narration/&Telema_14_MeetingScavs_Cleric=Resting… he was in pretty bad shape, but he'll be okay.
Narration/&Telema_15_MeetingScavs_Cleric=He said you need help.
Narration/&Telema_16_MeetingScavs_Dek=We did. If only you'd come sooner…
Narration/&Telema_17_MeetingScavs_Choice=What happened?
Narration/&Telema_18_MeetingScavs_Answer=We came as soon as we could. What happened?
Narration/&Telema_19_MeetingScavs_Lena=We know… and thanks.
Narration/&Telema_20_MeetingScavs_Lena=Dek here is upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_21_MeetingScavs_Dek=I can speak for myself, thank you!
Narration/&Telema_22_MeetingScavs_Lena=He thinks we should have left with Runnel.
Narration/&Telema_23_MeetingScavs_Dek=Instead of waiting here for the orcs to kill us?
Narration/&Telema_24_MeetingScavs_Dek=Absolutely, I think we should have left!
Narration/&Telema_25_MeetingScavs_Choice=We're here now.
Narration/&Telema_26_MeetingScavs_Answer=Well, we're here now. How can we help?
Narration/&Telema_27_MeetingScavs_Lena=Never mind Dek.
Narration/&Telema_28_MeetingScavs_Lena=He's upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_29_MeetingScavs_Dek=I can speak for myself, thank you!
Narration/&Telema_30_MeetingScavs_Lena=He thinks we should have left with Runnel.
Narration/&Telema_31_MeetingScavs_Dek=Instead of waiting for the orcs to kill us?
Narration/&Telema_32_MeetingScavs_Dek=Absolutely, I think we should have left!
Narration/&Telema_33_MeetingScavs_Choice=We could go back.
Narration/&Telema_34_MeetingScavs_Answer=Well, if we're too late, maybe we should just go back.
Narration/&Telema_35_MeetingScavs_Dek=Yes, well, maybe you should!
Narration/&Telema_36_MeetingScavs_Lena=Never mind Dek.
Narration/&Telema_37_MeetingScavs_Lena=He's upset, that's all.
Narration/&Telema_38_MeetingScavs_Dek=Upset? Why should I be upset? We're just waiting to die, that's all!
Narration/&Telema_39_MeetingScavs_Lena=We can't leave Hector in there.
Narration/&Telema_40_MeetingScavs_Dek=He's dead, Lena… dead! It's too late!
Narration/&Telema_41_MeetingScavs_Lena=You don't know that!
Narration/&Telema_42_MeetingScavs_Choice=Calm down.
Narration/&Telema_43_MeetingScavs_Answer=Calm down, now. This won't help.
Narration/&Telema_44_MeetingScavs_Choice=We'll help you.
Narration/&Telema_45_MeetingScavs_Answer=It's all right… we're here to help you.
Narration/&Telema_46_MeetingScavs_Choice=Amazing.
Narration/&Telema_47_MeetingScavs_Answer=Why don't you just kill each other and save the orcs the trouble?
Narration/&Telema_48_MeetingScavs_Rogue=What's our help worth to you, anyway?
Narration/&Telema_49_MeetingScavs_Fighter=Stop it!
Narration/&Telema_50_MeetingScavs_Lena=All right.
Narration/&Telema_51_MeetingScavs_Lena=What did Runnel tell you?
Narration/&Telema_52_MeetingScavs_Fighter=Just that his team needed help… nothing else.
Narration/&Telema_53_MeetingScavs_Lena=We were scavenging in the ruins, and -
Narration/&Telema_54_MeetingScavs_Dek=Orcs! There's a whole tribe in there!
Narration/&Telema_55_MeetingScavs_Lena=It was just a raiding party.
Narration/&Telema_56_MeetingScavs_Lena=We fought them off…
Narration/&Telema_57_MeetingScavs_Lena=…but they killed some of our people and dragged Hector off.
Narration/&Telema_58_MeetingScavs_Dek=And we've just been waiting here for them to come and finish the job.
Narration/&Telema_59_MeetingScavs_Fighter=They haven't done that yet, though.
Narration/&Telema_60_MeetingScavs_Rogue=Well, you're right about your friend…
Narration/&Telema_61_MeetingScavs_Rogue=…he must be dead by now.
Narration/&Telema_62_MeetingScavs_Cleric=We don't know that. There is always hope.
Narration/&Telema_63_MeetingScavs_Rogue=Hope? Those orcs had him for dinner the first night.
Narration/&Telema_64_MeetingScavs_Wizard=I don't know… they took him alive, after all…
Narration/&Telema_65_MeetingScavs_Rogue=So they wanted to keep him fresh… orcs are orcs!
Narration/&Telema_66_MeetingScavs_Fighter=Ignore them. So, we just need to go in and find Hector?
Narration/&Telema_67_MeetingScavs_Dek=Yeah… good luck with that!
Narration/&Telema_68_MeetingScavs_Cleric=Why is he so angry?
Narration/&Telema_69_MeetingScavs_Lena=He and Hector don't exactly get along.
Narration/&Telema_70_MeetingScavs_Lena=But he's one of our crew…
Narration/&Telema_71_MeetingScavs_Lena=…and I won't leave anyone behind.
Narration/&Telema_72_MeetingScavs_Cleric=We gave our word to your leaders.
Narration/&Telema_73_MeetingScavs_Cleric=We will get Hector back.
Narration/&Telema_74_MeetingScavs_Lena=Thanks.
Narration/&Telema_75_MeetingScavs_Lena=Do you need food?
Narration/&Telema_76_MeetingScavs_Fighter=You think we'll be away for that long?
Narration/&Telema_77_MeetingScavs_Lena=You can never be too careful…
Narration/&Telema_78_MeetingScavs_Lena=…that's the law of the Badlands.
Narration/&Telema_79_MeetingScavs_Lena=We can spare some if you need it.
Narration/&Telema_80_MeetingScavs_Lena=We have more than we need for just the two of us.
Narration/&Telema_81_MeetingScavs_Dek=Are you serious?
Narration/&Telema_82_MeetingScavs_Dek=You're giving away our food?
Narration/&Telema_83_MeetingScavs_Lena=They're risking their lives for us, Dek.
Narration/&Telema_84_MeetingScavs_Dek=For Hector. We can starve, apparently.
Narration/&Telema_85_MeetingScavs_ChoiceIntimidate=The rescuers get the food.
Narration/&Telema_86_MeetingScavs_AnswerIntimidate=The rescuers get the food.
Narration/&Telema_87_MeetingScavs_Fighter=Get it?
Narration/&Telema_88_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess=I don't believe it.
Narration/&Telema_89_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess=That's on you, Lena.
Narration/&Telema_90_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess=Don't worry,
Narration/&Telema_91_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess=that's just the way he is.
Narration/&Telema_92_MeetingScavs_Clericchecksuccess=Thanks, Lena.
Narration/&Telema_93_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed=No.
Narration/&Telema_94_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed=Nice try.
Narration/&Telema_95_MeetingScavs_Fightercheckfailed=Shut up.
Narration/&Telema_96_MeetingScavs_Fighter=We should get moving and find your friend.
Narration/&Telema_97_MeetingScavs_Lena=Thanks!
Narration/&Telema_98_MeetingScavs_Lena=And good luck!
Narration/&Telema_99_MeetingScavs_ChoicePersuasion=You're right… keep your food.
Narration/&Telema_100_MeetingScavs_AnswerPersuasion=You're right… keep it. We'll survive.
Narration/&Telema_101_MeetingScavs_Cleric=We'll be back in no time.
Narration/&Telema_102_MeetingScavs_Cleric=If not, you'll have enough to eat.
Narration/&Telema_103_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess=Don't look at me.
Narration/&Telema_104_MeetingScavs_Lenachecksuccess=Just one day of food, Dek.
Narration/&Telema_105_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess=All right, take the damn food!
Narration/&Telema_106_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess=Thank you!
Narration/&Telema_107_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed=Absolutely.
Narration/&Telema_108_MeetingScavs_Choice=Your boss said you'd feed us.
Narration/&Telema_109_MeetingScavs_Answer=Your boss said we could take whatever resources we needed.
Narration/&Telema_110_MeetingScavs_Dek=Did he?
Narration/&Telema_111_MeetingScavs_Rogue=Are you calling me a liar?
Narration/&Telema_112_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess=No.
Narration/&Telema_113_MeetingScavs_Deceptionchecksuccess=So?
Narration/&Telema_114_MeetingScavs_Dekchecksuccess=So take the damn food!
Narration/&Telema_115_MeetingScavs_Dekcheckfailed=Why not?
Narration/&Telema_116_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed=Fair enough.
Narration/&Telema_117_MeetingScavs_Wizardcheckfailed=Impressive negotiation skills.
Narration/&Telema_118_MeetingScavs_Roguecheckfailed=He's stubborn, that's all.
Narration/&TelemaBasReliefTitle=A Sight for Sore Eyes
Narration/&Telema_119_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard=Look at that!
Narration/&Telema_120_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard=Perfectly preserved!
Narration/&Telema_121_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric=What is it?
Narration/&Telema_122_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard=It's a scene from the Imperial conquest of the northern provinces.
Narration/&Telema_123_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric=When the Empire ruled the lands of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Telema_124_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric=I can't pretend to feel nostalgic about those times.
Narration/&Telema_125_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard=Nostalgic? That was more than a thousand years ago!
Narration/&Telema_126_Room01_BasRelief_Cleric=The Old Empire was built on slavery and racism.
Narration/&Telema_127_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue=Thanks for the (yawn) history lesson.
Narration/&Telema_128_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue=Now… does this look valuable to you?
Narration/&Telema_129_Room01_BasRelief_Wizard=All history is valuable, my friend.
Narration/&Telema_130_Room01_BasRelief_Rogue=Tell that to my purse.
Narration/&Telema_131_Room01_BasRelief_Fighter=Anyway, this doesn't help Hector, so let's move out.
Narration/&TelemaChestTitle=Too Good to Be True
Narration/&Telema_132_Room01_Chest_Fighter=Well, that's interesting.
Narration/&Telema_133_Room01_Chest_Rogue=You don't say! Look at that!
Narration/&Telema_134_Room01_Chest_Fighter=I'd be careful if I were you.
Narration/&Telema_135_Room01_Chest_Fighter=It looks too good to be true.
Narration/&Telema_136_Room01_Chest_Rogue=That's right. You can't be too careful…
Narration/&Telema_137_Room01_Chest_Rogue=…that's the law of the Badlands.
Narration/&TelemaStatueTitle=Memory of the Past
Narration/&Telema_138_Room01_Statue_Rogue=Try not to stare… you're making that statue uncomfortable.
Narration/&Telema_139_Room01_Statue_Wizard=But it's… can you read this?
Narration/&Telema_140_Room01_Statue_Rogue=Never had the benefit of an Imperial indoctrin… I mean, education.
Narration/&Telema_141_Room01_Statue_Cleric=That's Emperor Gildean the Third.
Narration/&Telema_142_Room01_Statue_Rogue=How do you know?
Narration/&Telema_143_Room01_Statue_Cleric=It's written here.
Narration/&Telema_144_Room01_Statue_Cleric=For those who can read it.
Narration/&Telema_145_Room01_Statue_Rogue=That's nice for you, I'm sure.
Narration/&Telema_146_Room01_Statue_Wizard=His was a very ancient dynasty.
Narration/&Telema_147_Room01_Statue_Wizard=Look at his date of birth.
Narration/&Telema_148_Room01_Statue_Cleric=And location.
Narration/&Telema_149_Room01_Statue_Wizard=Wait! I must copy this.
Narration/&Telema_150_Room01_Statue_Wizard=The Tower will find this interesting.
Narration/&Telema_151_Room01_Statue_Fighter=Are you done?
Narration/&TelemaDoorTitle=Dead End?
Narration/&Telema_152_Room01_Door_Rogue=Can we open it?
Narration/&Telema_153_Room01_Door_Fighter=I don't see how.
Narration/&Telema_154_Room01_Door_Wizard=Must be magically sealed.
Narration/&Telema_155_Room01_Door_Cleric=Do you think a magic seal from Imperial times would still work?
Narration/&Telema_156_Room01_Door_Fighter=In the Badlands, anything's possible.
Narration/&Telema_157_Room01_Door_Rogue=Do you have a spell to open it?
Narration/&Telema_158_Room01_Door_Wizard=No.
Narration/&Telema_159_Room01_Door_Fighter=Let's not waste time, then. Move out!
Narration/&Telema_160_Room01_Crawl_Rogue=They must have gone through here after they took Hector.
Narration/&Telema_161_Room01_Crawl_Cleric=Really? We need to crawl through there?
Narration/&Telema_162_Room01_Crawl_Rogue=Yeah, but you don't mind being on your knees, do you?
Narration/&Telema_163_Room01_Crawl_Cleric=Very funny.
Narration/&Telema_164_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter=I see light ahead!
Narration/&Telema_165_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue=Let me take a look before you go clanking around in your armor.
Narration/&Telema_166_OrcCamp_approach_Fighter=Be careful!
Narration/&Telema_167_OrcCamp_approach_Rogue=Law of the Badlands, my friend.
Narration/&TelemaBackFromReconTitle=Meeting the Locals
Narration/&Telema_168_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue=The orcs are here.
Narration/&Telema_169_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue=Looks like we can sneak around.
Narration/&Telema_170_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter=Even me?
Narration/&Telema_171_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue=Ehh… probably.
Narration/&Telema_172_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric=Did you see Hector?
Narration/&Telema_173_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue=Not a trace.
Narration/&Telema_174_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Fighter=We should attack… we have the element of surprise.
Narration/&Telema_175_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Cleric=But what if Hector's down there too?
Narration/&Telema_176_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Wizard=I hear some orc tribes can be bartered with.
Narration/&Telema_177_OrcCamp_BackFromRecon_Rogue=Not these orcs.
Narration/&TelemaOrcCampExitTitle=Disappointment…
Narration/&Telema_178_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter=So, no Hector?
Narration/&Telema_179_OrcCamp_exit_Wizard=It doesn't make any sense.
Narration/&Telema_180_OrcCamp_exit_Cleric=Maybe he's farther down.
Narration/&Telema_181_OrcCamp_exit_Fighter=All right, let's keep looking.
Narration/&TelemaVerticalEntranceTitle=Lighting the Darkness
Narration/&Telema_182_Vertical_entrance_Fighter=I don't like this.
Narration/&Telema_183_Vertical_entrance_Rogue=We can climb down.
Narration/&Telema_184_Vertical_entrance_Wizard=It's too dark.
Narration/&Telema_185_Vertical_entrance_Cleric=Too unstable, too. These blocks look like they could fall at any minute.
Narration/&Telema_186_Vertical_entrance_Wizard=There's some kind of black oil dripping from the ceiling.
Narration/&Telema_187_Vertical_entrance_Wizard=Maybe we can use it to light up the place.
Narration/&TelemaVerticalExitTitle=No Way Back
Narration/&Telema_188_Vertical_exit_Rogue=Damn it! Now we're stuck!
Narration/&Telema_189_Vertical_exit_Fighter=Do you think the orcs would bring Hector farther in than this?
Narration/&Telema_190_Vertical_exit_Wizard=Not the orcs, no…
Narration/&Telema_191_Vertical_exit_Wizard=…but something else… maybe.
Narration/&Telema_192_Vertical_exit_Fighter=We've come this far… let's find him.
Narration/&Telema_193_Vertical_exit_Rogue=I'm starting to think we might need that food after all.
Narration/&TelemaShaftEntranceTitle=Unexpected Denizens
Narration/&Telema_194_Shaft_entrance_Cleric=What is this… an amphitheater?
Narration/&Telema_195_Shaft_entrance_Wizard=A very special one.
Narration/&Telema_196_Shaft_entrance_Rogue=Not room for much of a crowd…
Narration/&Telema_197_Shaft_entrance_Wizard=Students of magic. The Masters taught spells here.
Narration/&Telema_198_Shaft_entrance_Fighter=Do spiders like magic shows?
Narration/&Telema_199_Shaft_entrance_Fighter=Because I see a lot of webs.
Narration/&Telema_200_Shaft_entrance_Wizard=Deep spiders. We will have to be careful.
Narration/&Telema_201_Shaft_entrance_Fighter=Deep Spiders?
Narration/&Telema_202_Shaft_entrance_Cleric=Very large and aggressive, but sensitive to light.
Narration/&Telema_203_Shaft_entrance_Rogue=Just how large is very large?
Narration/&Telema_204_Shaft_entrance_Wizard=Just keep your lights ready…
Narration/&Telema_205_Shaft_entrance_Wizard=…and your oil handy.
Narration/&Telema_206_Shaft_entrance_Wizard=The more light we have, the fewer spiders we'll face.
Narration/&Telema_207_Shaft_entrance_Fighter=We don't have a choice here. The only way out is up.
Narration/&TelemaShaftUpperTitle=A Way Out?
Narration/&Telema_208_Shaft_upper_Fighter=How many are there?
Narration/&Telema_209_Shaft_upper_Rogue=You don't want to know.
Narration/&Telema_210_Shaft_upper_Cleric=Try pushing this down!
Narration/&Telema_211_Shaft_upper_Cleric=I feel a weakness here.
Narration/&TelemaShaftCollapsedTitle=Escape… to Hector!
Narration/&Telema_212_Shaft_collapsed_Wizard=Well done!
Narration/&Telema_213_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue=You sure they're dead?
Narration/&Telema_214_Shaft_collapsed_Fighter=Well, they're not coming back.
Narration/&Telema_215_Shaft_collapsed_Rogue=Good.
Narration/&Telema_216_Shaft_collapsed_Cleric=My friends, I believe I have found Hector.
Narration/&Telema_217_Rescue_Hector=By all the gods at once… thank you!
Narration/&Telema_218_Rescue_Fighter=Are you Hector?
Narration/&Telema_219_Rescue_Hector=Yes! And you?
Narration/&Telema_220_Rescue_Fighter=The boss sent us. Runnel went for help.
Narration/&Telema_221_Rescue_Hector=Runnel! So he survived?
Narration/&Telema_222_Rescue_Cleric=Barely, but yes.
Narration/&Telema_223_Rescue_Cleric=He's safely back in town.
Narration/&Telema_224_Rescue_Rogue=So, did the spiders take you?
Narration/&Telema_225_Rescue_Hector=The orcs did, after their raid.
Narration/&Telema_226_Rescue_Hector=They kept me for a while.
Narration/&Telema_227_Rescue_Hector=I was wondering why.
Narration/&Telema_228_Rescue_Hector=I finally got the answer when they…
Narration/&Telema_229_Rescue_Hector=…well, they sacrificed me.
Narration/&Telema_230_Rescue_Fighter=What?
Narration/&Telema_231_Rescue_Hector=They feed the spiders. So they don't get eaten themselves.
Narration/&Telema_232_Rescue_Hector=They leave captives at the top of the amphitheater.
Narration/&Telema_233_Rescue_Rogue=Oh, that one?
Narration/&Telema_234_Rescue_Rogue=We kind of… destroyed it.
Narration/&Telema_235_Rescue_Fighter=The spider nest, too.
Narration/&Telema_236_Rescue_Hector=Interesting.
Narration/&Telema_237_Rescue_Hector=I'm not sure how the orcs will react to that.
Narration/&Telema_238_Rescue_Hector=This spider cult seemed important to them.
Narration/&Telema_239_Rescue_Fighter=Can't say I feel sorry for them.
Narration/&Telema_240_Rescue_Hector=I owe you my life. Thanks again.
Narration/&Telema_241_Rescue_Cleric=You are most welcome.
Narration/&Telema_242_Rescue_Fighter=You should rest, and I think we should do the same.
Narration/&Telema_243_Rescue_Hector=Good idea.
Narration/&Telema_244_Rescue_Choice=What's your story?
Narration/&Telema_245_Rescue_Answer=So Hector, what's your story?
Narration/&Telema_246_Rescue_Hector=Me? I'm just another Scavenger, really.
Narration/&Telema_247_Rescue_Hector=I make a living bringing old stuff out of the Badlands.
Narration/&Telema_248_Rescue_Choice=What about Lena and Dek?
Narration/&Telema_249_Rescue_Answer=Do you know Lena and Dek? They seem like quite a pair!
Narration/&Telema_250_Rescue_Hector=Oh, those two… always fighting over something.
Narration/&Telema_251_Rescue_Hector=But you couldn't separate them if you wanted to.
Narration/&Telema_252_Rescue_Fighter=They seemed pretty much at each other's throats.
Narration/&Telema_253_Rescue_Hector=Yeah, like I said… always fighting.
Narration/&Telema_254_Rescue_Hector=But in battle, always back to back.
Narration/&Telema_255_Rescue_Rogue=Aww… that's so sweet.
Narration/&Telema_256_Rescue_Choice=Did you find anything good in here?
Narration/&Telema_257_Rescue_Answer=Did you find anything good in the ruins?
Narration/&Telema_258_Rescue_Hector=No, not much. You've seen the state of the place…
Narration/&Telema_259_Rescue_Hector=…but there was something.
Narration/&Telema_260_Rescue_Hector=Didn't have time to use it.
Narration/&Telema_261_Rescue_Fighter=What is it?
Narration/&Telema_262_Rescue_Rogue=A key?
Narration/&Telema_263_Rescue_Hector=I think it opens the door in the ruins.
Narration/&Telema_264_Rescue_Rogue=Oh, yeah… that door.
Narration/&Telema_265_Rescue_Hector=At least, I hope it does.
Narration/&Telema_266_Rescue_Hector=Not much else, though. I think the orcs got it all.
Narration/&Telema_267_Rescue_Choice=You're a cleric of Einar?
Narration/&Telema_268_Rescue_Answer=You're wearing the flaming sword.
Narration/&Telema_269_Rescue_Hector=And I can see you're from the Order of the Beacon.
Narration/&Telema_270_Rescue_Cleric=Are you a priest, Hector?
Narration/&Telema_271_Rescue_Hector=Just a humble follower.
Narration/&Telema_272_Rescue_Hector=This was given to me by one of your brothers.
Narration/&Telema_273_Rescue_Hector=We fought together… he felt like he owed me.
Narration/&Telema_274_Rescue_Hector=And he gave me this.
Narration/&Telema_275_After_Rest_Fighter=I think we're all ready to go.
Narration/&Telema_276_After_Rest_Wizard=Indeed.
Narration/&Telema_277_After_Rest_Cleric=I think we're close to the surface.
Narration/&Telema_278_After_Rest_Cleric=I can feel it.
Narration/&Telema_279_After_Rest_Fighter=All right… let's move.
Narration/&Telema_280_Ambush_Fighter=Orcs! Over there!
Narration/&Telema_281_Ambush_Rogue=It's an ambush!
Narration/&Telema_282_Ambush_Fighter=Time to fight!
Narration/&Telema_283_WayBack_Fighter=Hey! Take a look at this.
Narration/&Telema_284_WayBack_Cleric=The stone is carved.
Narration/&Telema_285_WayBack_Fighter=Are we back near the ruins?
Narration/&Telema_286_WayBack_Cleric=It looks fragile, let's try pushing it.
Narration/&Telema_287_WayBack_Fighter=Well done… we're back in the ruins!
Narration/&Telema_288_WayBack_Rogue=So, do you still have that key?
Narration/&Telema_289_WayBack_Hector=Sure.
Narration/&Telema_290_WayBack_Hector=Take it.
Narration/&Telema_291_Magic_Door_Wizard=Amazing!
Narration/&Telema_292_Magic_Door_Wizard=This room hasn't been opened in a millennium!
Narration/&Telema_293_Magic_Door_Cleric=Those books are falling to pieces.
Narration/&Telema_294_Magic_Door_Wizard=Not this one!
Narration/&Telema_295_Magic_Door_Cleric=Look around for other valuables.
Narration/&Telema_296_Magic_Door_Rogue=Already doing it!
Narration/&Telema_297_Exit_Temple_Lena=Hey! Here they are!
Narration/&Telema_298_Exit_Temple_Dek=I'll be damned… they're alive!
Narration/&Telema_299_Exit_Temple_Fighter=We told you we'd find him.
Narration/&Telema_300_Exit_Temple_Lena=Hector?
Narration/&Telema_301_Exit_Temple_Dek=Lena, wait!
Narration/&Telema_302_Exit_Temple_Cleric=What's going on?
Narration/&Telema_303_Exit_Temple_Lena=That's not Hector!
Narration/&Telema_304_Exit_Temple_Fighter=What?
Narration/&Telema_305_Exit_Temple_Rogue=Then just who are you, friend?
Narration/&Telema_306_Exit_Temple_Hector=Put down your weapons.
Narration/&Telema_307_Exit_Temple_Fighter=Why would we do that?
Narration/&Tavern_01_1_Stealth_Normal=This beer tastes like donkey piss. Not that I'm complaining.
Narration/&Tavern_01_2_Explorer_Default=Hope I'm not too late.
Narration/&Tavern_01_3_Explorer_Normal=Ran into a bit of trouble on the way here.
Narration/&Tavern_01_4_Spellcaster_Normal=Take the load off. There's plenty of donkey piss to go around.
Narration/&Tavern_01_5_Spellcaster_Formal=Sit. Relax. Perhaps you'd enjoy a pint of this obnoxious ale?
Narration/&Tavern_01_6_Fighter_Default=Here for the Council job? Join the club.
Narration/&Tavern_01_7_Fighter_Authoritative=If you're here for the Council job, get in line.
Narration/&Tavern_01_8_Fighter_Friendly=You're not too late, friend. We're all here for the same reason.
Narration/&Tavern_01_9_Fighter_Default=Apparently, Lord Carran likes to keep people waiting.
Narration/&Tavern_01_10_Fighter_Authoritative=Though if this Lord Carran doesn't show up soon, I may go looking for him.
Narration/&Tavern_01_11_Fighter_Friendly=Grab a chair.
Narration/&Tavern_01_12_Stealth_Default=Another round, barkeeper. Four of your finest flagons of donkey piss, please!
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Default=Looks like you've been waiting here a while.
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Formal=I see you're all making the best of this.
Narration/&Tavern_01_13_Explorer_Slang=So is this the job? Getting shitfaced?
Narration/&Tavern_01_14_Spellcaster_Normal=We do what we have to. So what's this trouble you were telling us about?
Narration/&Tavern_01_15_Spellcaster_Formal=Indeed. You mentioned something about some trouble. Would you care to elaborate?
Narration/&Tavern_01_16_Explorer_Normal=Well, I was making my way here…
Narration/&Tavern_01_17_Explorer_Normal=…when three bandits leapt out of the bushes with crossbows.
Narration/&Tavern_01_18_Explorer_Normal=They dragged me off to some decrepit prison…
Narration/&Tavern_01_19_Explorer_Normal=…and tossed me in a filthy cell that smelled of rat piss.
Narration/&Tavern_01_20_Explorer_Slang=Well, I was heading down a lonely road…
Narration/&Tavern_01_21_Explorer_Slang=…when three shitheads jumped from the bushes, dragged me off…
Narration/&Tavern_01_22_Explorer_Slang=…and threw my ass in this rundown jail.
Narration/&Tavern_01_23_Explorer_Slang=Smelled like some poor bastard had died in there.
Narration/&Tavern_01_24_Explorer_Formal=I was proceeding down the highway, minding my own business…
Narration/&Tavern_01_25_Explorer_Formal=…when three brigands burst out of the bushes and waylaid me.
Narration/&Tavern_01_26_Explorer_Formal=They carried me off to some ramshackle prison.
Narration/&Tavern_01_27_Explorer_Formal=An Imperial ruin of some sort…
Narration/&Tavern_01_28_Explorer_Formal=Fortunately, the walls were as weak as this mediocre ale we're drinking.
Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Normal=…Don't know what was holding the place up…
Narration/&Tavern_01_29_Explorer_Slang=…a strong wind coulda taken it down.
Narration/&Tavern_02_1_Fighter_Normal=Nice move, that trick with the wall. Glad you're no worse for wear.
Narration/&Tavern_02_2_Fighter_Formal=So you escaped unscathed. Well done, my friend!
Narration/&Tavern_02_3_Explorer_Normal=My flagon is empty of ale, and Lord Carran still isn't here.
Narration/&Tavern_02_4_Explorer_Cynical=Perhaps someone else can tell a story since it looks like we might be here a while.
Narration/&Tavern_02_5_Explorer_Lawful=This Council needs to get organized. They have no right to keep us waiting like this.
Narration/&Tavern_02_6_Spellcaster_Normal=Have another ale. It's not like you have anywhere better to be.
Narration/&Tavern_02_7_Spellcaster_Greedy=I don't mind waiting as long as they pay us for our darned time.
Narration/&Tavern_02_8_Spellcaster_Aristocrat=The Council is likely busy with important matters of state, and we are not, so have patience.
Narration/&Tavern_02_9_Spellcaster_Lowlife=You think the Council cares about the likes of us? They'll get to us when they're good and ready.
Narration/&Tavern_02_10_Fighter_Normal=Well, let me tell you my story then. I, too, was accosted on the way here, but I faced my foes head on.
Narration/&Tavern_02_11_Fighter_Violent=I have a tale to tell as well. I, too, was attacked, but I put an end to my enemies with blood and pain.
Narration/&Tavern_02_12_Stealth_Slang=So what are you waiting for? Spit it out, why don't you?
Narration/&Tavern_02_13_Stealth_Normal=Let's hear it, then. Don't be shy.
Narration/&Tavern_02_14_Stealth_Formal=Proceed, then. Everyone enjoys a tale well told.
Narration/&Tavern_02_15_Merton_Default=What a bunch namby-pambies! You're lucky you weren't attacked by Soraks!
Narration/&Tavern_02_16_Fighter_Normal=I don't remember anyone asking your opinion.
Narration/&Tavern_02_17_Fighter_Violent=Shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for ya!
Narration/&Tavern_02_18_Fighter_Friendly=That's right, buddy. It's always good to be lucky.
Narration/&Tavern_02_19_Merton_Default=The Badlands are thick with 'em. Shapeshifting bastards!
Narration/&Tavern_02_20_Stealth_Normal=Never mind him. He's just another drunk Scavenger.
Narration/&Tavern_02_21_Stealth_Cynical=Everyone's a critic.
Narration/&Tavern_02_22_Stealth_Einar=I'm so tired of stupid drunks ranting about mythical creatures.
Narration/&Tavern_02_23_Explorer_Default=Aren't all drunks basically stupid?
Narration/&Tavern_02_24_Spellcaster_Default=Soraks might be legend, but orcs are quite real, and not just in the Badlands.
Narration/&Tavern_02_25_Spellcaster_Default=…I stumbled across a secret settlement right here in the Principality.
Narration/&Tavern_02_26_Fighter_Normal=What?
Narration/&Tavern_02_27_Fighter_Slang=Bullshit!
Narration/&Tavern_02_28_Fighter_Formal=That is preposterous.
Narration/&Tavern_02_29_Spellcaster_Normal=High in the hills, two days west of here.
Narration/&Tavern_02_30_Spellcaster_Normal=I left the main road to find a shorter way through…
Narration/&Tavern_02_31_Spellcaster_Normal=And I was making good time…
Narration/&Tavern_02_32_Spellcaster_Normal=…when I dropped through a frickin' sinkhole into a cave.
Narration/&Tavern_02_33_Spellcaster_Slang=I was dragging my weary ass up the hills west of here…
Narration/&Tavern_02_34_Spellcaster_Slang=…and decided to leave the road to look for a shortcut.
Narration/&Tavern_02_35_Spellcaster_Slang=It was beautiful day. Blue skies. Birds singing. I watched one take wing…
Narration/&Tavern_02_36_Spellcaster_Slang=…and fell right into a blasted hole.
Narration/&Tavern_02_37_Spellcaster_Formal=I traveled here from the east, and left the main highway…
Narration/&Tavern_02_38_Spellcaster_Formal=…hoping to save time by traversing the hills.
Narration/&Tavern_02_39_Spellcaster_Formal=The views were magnificent, but I should have kept my eye on the path.
Narration/&Tavern_02_40_Spellcaster_Formal=Because it gave way beneath my feet, plunging me into gloomy darkness.
Narration/&Tavern_03_1_Fighter_Selfpres=Not sure I would have slept so close to a horde of orcs.
Narration/&Tavern_03_2_Fighter_Violence=I would have slaughtered every one of those green-skinned monsters.
Narration/&Tavern_03_3_Fighter_Cynical=You slept with a bunch of orcs? That explains the smell.
Narration/&Tavern_03_4_Spellcaster_Default=Orcs have a very distinctive stink.
Narration/&Tavern_03_5_Stealth_Cynical=I'm beginning to think Lord Carran might be a mythical creature.
Narration/&Tavern_03_6_Stealth_Violence=If Lord Carran keeps us waiting much longer, I might greet him with a dagger.
Narration/&Tavern_03_7_Stealth_Lawful=We should bill the Council for all this wasted time.
Narration/&Tavern_03_8_Explorer_Default=We've all told a tale of our travels here. All but one of us.
Narration/&Tavern_03_9_Stealth_Default=Yes, but I have a good reason for that. It's none of your damn business.
Narration/&Tavern_03_10_Fighter_Slang=Come on, now. Don't be a killjoy. We all sang for our supper. Now it's your turn!
Narration/&Tavern_03_11_Fighter_Formal=We can't take up arms together if we don't trust each other.
Narration/&Tavern_03_12_Fighter_Normal=You can't have a true friendship without trust. What are you hiding?
Narration/&Tavern_03_13_Stealth_Default=Fine - you want to know the truth?
Narration/&Tavern_03_14_Stealth_Default=I stopped on the way here to visit an old friend of mine…
Narration/&Tavern_03_15_Stealth_Default=And discovered he was up to his eyeballs in debt with a loan shark.
Narration/&Tavern_03_16_Explorer_Normal=Oh, that's not good.
Narration/&Tavern_03_17_Explorer_Slang=Sounds like an idiot.
Narration/&Tavern_03_18_Explorer_Formal=So he was in dire straits?
Narration/&Tavern_03_19_Stealth_Default=Indeed. He put up a family heirloom as collateral and wanted me to reacquire it.
Narration/&Tavern_03_20_Stealth_Default=Because, you see, I can be quite stealthy when necessary.
Narration/&Tavern_041_Carran_NPC=Are you four here to see Lord Carran?
Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical_WRITTEN=We're not here to get drunk.
Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic_WRITTEN=Who's asking?
Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence_WRITTEN=Maybe we're here looking for a fight.
Narration/&Tavern_042_Stealth_Cynical=Well, we're not here to drink ourselves to death.
Narration/&Tavern_043_Stealth_Pragmatic=Depends on who's asking.
Narration/&Tavern_044_Stealth_Violence=Maybe. Or maybe we're here just to raise hell and break heads.
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_cynical_NPC=Well, thank you for making that clear…
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_violent_NPC=A fight, is it? I'm sure we can find an outlet for your… enthusiasm.
Narration/&Tavern_045_Carran_NPC=Well, if you are here for Lord Carran of the Legacy Council, that would be me.
Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical_WRITTEN=So you're real, then?
Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful_WRITTEN=We're ready.
Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy_WRITTEN=We should get paid for waiting.
Narration/&Tavern_046_Fighter_Cynical=So you're not a mythical creature after all.
Narration/&Tavern_047_Fighter_Lawful=Then we are here at your service, sir.
Narration/&Tavern_048_Fighter_Greedy=Fine. I'd like to present you with a bill for the time we just spent cooling our heels.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Cynical=Unlike, say, a sober adventurer?
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Lawful=Very good.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_Greedy=Feel free. The Council's bursary enjoys a good laugh.
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Formal=Might we ask a bit more about this quest of yours, sir, if you please?
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Normal=Can you tell us more about the job?
Narration/&Tavern_049_01_Authority_Slang=We kinda need a little bit more info 'bout the job, milord.
Narration/&Tavern_049_02_Carran_NPC=Well, I suppose it's better if you know what you're doing.
Narration/&Tavern_049_03_Carran_NPC=What do you want to know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_WRITTEN=About the Legacy Council.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_WRITTEN=About the Principality.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_WRITTEN=Are you our employer?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_WRITTEN=We're good, thank you.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_ExitLine_Audio=We should be going, don't you think?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Choice=What can you tell us about this place, the Principality?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran01=We don't exactly have the time…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran02=…anyway. The Principality of Masgarth is ruled by Princess Ceiwad Silverflower.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran03=We are a wealthy state, with fertile lands, and the easiest access to the Badlands…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran04=…through a pass called the Copperhead Road.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran05=We're in the capital, Caer Cyflen, which was once part of the ancient Manacalon Empire of the high elves.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran06=Hence the magnificent elvish buildings up there in the high town.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran07=While we don't have a state religion, all of the major faiths on Solasta are represented here…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Principality_Carran08=…though we tend to favor Einar, the god of valor and fidelity.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Choice=Are we going to work for you?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran01=Not exactly, no. I'll be your contact with the Legacy Council, which you will serve as deputies.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_WhoAreYou_Carran02=That's why we need to go there and get you sworn in.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choice=We hear this is a mission for the Council, but what is it, exactly?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01=Dear Maraike! You don't know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02=I'll try to make it simple, but you know - politics…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03=The Council includes representatives of the most powerful and influential organizations in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04=It was created to lead a joint effort to explore the Badlands.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_WRITTEN=What are the Badlands?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Choice=What are the Badlands, really?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran01=Simply put, they are a monster-ridden, chaotic wasteland that used to be the elven empire called Manacalon.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran02=It was destroyed about a thousand years ago by the great Cataclysm.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Badlands_Carran03=Now, only ruins remain, full of forgotten knowledge, riches, and dangers.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_WRITTEN=What are the Eastern Kingdoms?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Choice=Which countries make up these Eastern Kingdoms?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran01=Simple. The Principality of Masgarth, here, is in the center.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran02=The Snow Alliance lies to the north.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran03=The Kingdom of Gallivan, to the east.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran04=And the New Empire, to the south.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Kingdoms_Carran05=All friendly, more or less, but the peace is fragile.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_WRITTEN=What organizations are there?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Choice=What are the organizations you mentioned?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran01=The Council is… how to put it? A non-governmental organization.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran02=Meaning that state governments are not represented, to avoid partisanship.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran03=Instead, there are delegates from the Guild of Antiquarians, the Tower of Knowledge, the Arcaneum, and the Circle of Danantar.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_Organizations_Carran04=And the Church of Einar guarantees fairness, led by Marshal Beric Sunblaze and Oathkeeper Leira Kean.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_WRITTEN=We know enough.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_More_ExitLine_Choice=I think we know enough now. Thank you!
Narration/&Tavern_049_Additional_Carran_NPC=Very well.
Narration/&Tavern_049_Carran_NPC=Come! Gather your things. You're late for your swearing in.
Narration/&Tavern_0410_Stealth_Lawful=Whose fault is that?
Narration/&Tavern_0411_Stealth_Cynical=Hurry up and wait. The story of my life.
Narration/&Tavern_0412_Stealth_Academic=I, for one, am very curious to see the inside of that Council room.
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_FindTools=Liam… always thoughtful.
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_01=There you are, you filthy crook!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark=You? What…? You're drunk! Get out of here before I kill you!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_Liam_02=Think you scare me? Not anymore!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LoanShark2=A grave mistake.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Normal=Ow! I must have fallen on my wrong side…
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Formal=Ow! That's going to leave a mark.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_FallRecover_Slang=Damn! That hurt like hell.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_nosy=Orcs, here? Strange. I wonder what this totem means.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_lukewarm=Just my luck, falling right into an orc hideout!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_wisecracker=Orcs? Of course, that explains the smell…
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_highclass=My word, this is an orc hideout! The malodor is unmistakable.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_preachy=Orcs? Clearly I'm being punished for leaving the road. Now to seek redemption.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_judgmental=Orcs, here? I must report this… which means, I must get out of here alive.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_mean=Damn me, like I needed to fall into an orc shithole!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_success_logical=An orc hideout right in the middle of the Principality… how surprising. Let's hope they've eaten recently.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_normal=What the… ? Whatever this is, it's not good.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_formal=What a peculiar style of art… clearly the work of some savage hand.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_failure_slang=Charming, that. Just as long as my head doesn't end up on the top.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs=There they are…
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_normal=…if they see me, I'm dead.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_formal=…discretion is clearly the better part of valor in this instance.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs2_slang=…head down, or I'm next on the menu.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_normal=What's worse, it looks like this is the only way out.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_formal=No other means of egress is apparent.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs3_slang=They're camped right by the only exit? It just keeps getting better!
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_normal=I just need to be patient. They can't stay there forever.
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_formal=Fine, then, I shall wait until they go. These creatures do hunt, right?
Narration/&Introduction_SpellcastingTuto_SeeingOrcs4_slang=Guess I'm waiting them out. At least these rocks are… damned uncomfortable.
Narration/&Council_00_1_Wow_Default=Look at this size of this Council hall!
Narration/&Council_00_2_Wow_Default=A very impressive edifice indeed.
Narration/&Council_00_3_joker_Default=So this is what they spend our taxes on.
Narration/&Council_00_4_Any_Default=Look! Is that…
Narration/&Council_00_5_Any_Default=The Princess!
Narration/&Council_00_6_Any_Default=Wait… is she leaving?
Narration/&Council_00_7_joker_Default=Apparently so…
Narration/&Council_00_8_Any_Default=Then who will administer the oath?
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default_WRITTEN=The maid who empties her chamber pot?
Narration/&Council_00_9_mean_Default_WRITTEN=We're too low for her.
Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_WRITTEN=It's not her role.
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Default=The maid who empties her chamber pot? No, we're not as important as that. Perhaps her stable boy.
Narration/&Council_00_9_joker_Slang=A lady like her wants nothing to do with drudges like us.
Narration/&Council_00_9_anyother_Default_Choice=There's an Oathkeeper for that, I think.
Narration/&Council_00_10_Carran_NPC=You thought it would be the Princess?
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_WRITTEN=She doesn't rule the Council?
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_WRITTEN=If not her, then who?
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default=Doesn't she lead the Council?
Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC=No, in this chamber, she's just another delegate.
Narration/&Council_00_11_Any_Default_Who_Choice=If she rules the whole Principality, who's more important?
Narration/&Council_00_12_Carran_NPC_02=Lady Kean, the Council's Oathkeeper, is trusted by all.
Narration/&Council_00_15_Chamberlain_NPC=Lord Carran!
Narration/&Council_00_16_Carran_NPC=Yes, m'lady!
Narration/&Council_00_17_Chamberlain_NPC=Are these your new deputies?
Narration/&Council_00_18_Carran_NPC=They are, m'lady.
Narration/&Council_00_19_Serious_Default=Very well. Pay attention. All of you.
Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Slang=Pipe down.
Narration/&Council_00_20_Serious_Normal=Shhh, quiet everyone!
Narration/&Council_00_21_Chamberlain_NPC=My name is Leira Kean, Oathkeeper of the Council.
Narration/&Council_00_22_Chamberlain_NPC=And I will be administering your vows.
Narration/&Council_00_23_Chamberlain_NPC=Once sworn in, you will carry the authority of the Council wherever you go.
Narration/&Council_00_24_Chamberlain_NPC=Your every action will reflect upon the Council's reputation. Remember that. Always.
Narration/&Council_00_25_Chamberlain_NPC=Now, please, raise your right hands.
Narration/&Council_00_26_Chamberlain_NPC=Do you, each and all, solemnly swear your lives and allegiance to this Council and promise…
Narration/&Council_00_27_Chamberlain_NPC=…to carry out our mission to protect our alliance from those who would threaten the common good?
Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default_WRITTEN=I swear.
Narration/&Council_00_28_All_Default=I swear.
Narration/&Council_00_29_Chamberlain_NPC=Excellent. Lord Carran will enter your name into Council's register. Thank you for your service.
Narration/&Council_00_30_Carran_NPC=Congratulations, deputies.
Narration/&Council_00_31_Any_Default=Wait, that's it?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Joke_WRITTEN=You were expecting a parade?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_WRITTEN=That was long enough.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_WRITTEN=Let's focus on the mission.
Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Default=What were you expecting? A parade?
Narration/&Council_00_32_joker_Slang=Were you hoping for a kiss from the Princess?
Narration/&Council_00_33_Any_Default=I suppose you imagined something more pompous.
Narration/&Council_00_34_Any_Default=No. I don't know. It just feels a bit… anticlimactic.
Narration/&Council_00_35_Carran_NPC=Sorry to disappoint.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Choice=Frankly, the speech was long enough for my taste.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran01=The formality reflects the solemnity of your oath.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Longenough_Carran02=But more would probably be… immodest.
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Choice=Stop wasting time! What's the mission?
Narration/&Council_00_32_Exitline_Carran=Well! A motivated deputy.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Carran_NPC=So - the mission:
Narration/&Council_00_44_Carran_NPC=As I'm sure you know, the Council maintains a number of outposts…
Narration/&Council_00_45_Carran_NPC=…to secure the border between the Principality and the Marches.
Narration/&Council_00_46_Carran_NPC=One of them is the former Imperial Fortress, Caer Lem.
Narration/&Council_00_47_Carran_NPC=It is held by some fifty troops under the command of Captain Henrik.
Narration/&Council_00_48_Carran_NPC=He sends us weekly status reports - or rather, he used to.
Narration/&Council_00_49_Carran_NPC=We haven't heard a word from him in three weeks.
Narration/&Council_00_50_Carran_NPC=Leave immediately for Caer Lem and find out if anyone there is still alive.
Narration/&Council_00_51_Carran_NPC=If Captain Henrik or anyone else is still breathing, bring them back.
Narration/&Council_00_52_Carran_NPC=The Council wants a first-hand report.
Narration/&Council_00_53_Dangerous_WRITTEN=Sounds dangerous.
Narration/&Council_00_54_Marches_WRITTEN=Wait - you spoke of the Marches?
Narration/&Council_00_55_Henrik_WRITTEN=Tell us about Captain Henrik.
Narration/&Council_00_56_ExitLine_WRITTEN=We're good to go.
Narration/&Council_00_57_Dangerous_Choice=A whole garrison, gone? There are only four of us.
Narration/&Council_00_58_Dangerous_Carran01=Just find out what happened. Run back if you get scared.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Normal=Got it. Though we were hoping for a first mission with more riches than risk, if you catch my drift.
Narration/&Council_00_42_Joker_Slang=We hear ya. Just so you know, we'd like to start slow. Meaning more treasure. Less danger.
Narration/&Council_00_59_Carran_NPC=You don't get to choose your mission, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Council_00_53_Carran_NPC=So gather what you need and go. Time is of the essence.
Narration/&Council_00_60_Marches_Choice=Wait! These Marches - they're not in the Badlands, are they?
Narration/&Council_00_61_Marches_Carran01=The Marches are a no-man's-land, between the civilized world and the Badlands.
Narration/&Council_00_62_Marches_Carran02=It's outside the chain of mountains that really define the Badlands.
Narration/&Council_00_63_Marches_Carran03=We wouldn't send you in there… yet.
Narration/&Council_00_64_Henrik_Choice=What can you tell us about this Captain Henrik?
Narration/&Council_00_65_Henrik_Carran01=A fine officer. More than fifteen years in the Principality's army.
Narration/&Council_00_66_Henrik_Carran02=He inspires trust, loyalty, and courage - hence the decision to post him there, facing danger.
Narration/&Council_00_54_Any_Default=Right, I guess that's that. It's on to Caer Lem.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_1_PotionShopOwner_NPC=Hello! How may I help you?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN=What do you sell?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN=Can we see your wares?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_4_Any_Default=What do you sell here?
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_5_PotionShopOwner_NPC=Mostly potions, for heroic adventurers like yourselves.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_6_PotionShopOwner_NPC=I also have recipes for customers who like to craft their own.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_7_PotionShopOwner_NPC=And ingredients too - even rare flowers from the Badlands.
Narration/&PotionsShop_Dialog_01_8_PotionShopOwner_NPC=Come back any time - I'm almost always open!
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_1_StoreOwner_NPC=Welcome to Gorim's Emporium!
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_2_Any_WRITTEN=Are you Gorim?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN=What do you sell?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN=Can we see your wares?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_5_Any_Default=Are you Gorim?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_6_StoreOwner_NPC=That's me! The one and only.
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_7_Any_Default=What do you have to sell?
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_8_StoreOwner_NPC=Everything you'll need for going out there into the Badlands…
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_9_StoreOwner_NPC=…food, ropes, torches - and of course, armor and weapons.
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_10_StoreOwner_NPC=I also have some other stock, like remedies and antitoxins.
Narration/&GeneralStore_Dialog_01_11_StoreOwner_NPC=They might come in handy. Ever heard of deep spiders?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_1_Bartender_NPC=Hello, adventurers!
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_2_Bartender_NPC=What can I offer you?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_3_Any_WRITTEN=Tell us about this place.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_4_Any_WRITTEN=Your beer tastes bad.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_Any_WRITTEN=We need a room.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any_WRITTEN=Goodbye.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_5_1_Any=We should go.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_6_Any_Default=Tell us about your tavern.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_7_Bartender_NPC=The inn? Well, it's not that old, but somehow it feels like it's been here forever.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_8_Bartender_NPC=You can meet all kinds of people here, that's the good thing.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_9_Bartender_NPC=An old Scavenger, a diplomat from the Council, a knight, a lord, a beggar…
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_Bartender_NPC=We also have rooms to rent by the night.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_1_Any_Default=Why the name - Gravekeep's Cask?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_10_2_Bartender_NPC=It's very old, from Imperial times. Perhaps a historian would know, but I don't.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_11_Any_Default=Your beer is terrible, and that's being polite about it.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_12_Bartender_NPC=What? I've never had any complaints about the beer before!
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_13_Bartender_NPC=Maybe your palate is not refined enough.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default=We'd like to stay for the night.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_15_Bartender_NPC=Sure! Just walk up to the suite and settle in.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_16_Any_Default=A suite?
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_17_Bartender_NPC=It's more like a large bedroom, really - but you know, this is the capital city.
Narration/&Bartender_Dialog_01_NoMoneyToPay=No money, eh. No room, then.
Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Hello=Clear skies, my friends.
Narration/&Scavengers_Generic_Goodbye=Stay in the light, my friends.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_1_Quartermaster_NPC=Deputies? A word, if you please.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_2_Joker_Default=So famous already? I love it!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_3_Any_Default=You were in there, too. Are you a member of the Council?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_4_Quartermaster_NPC=I'm Annie Bagmordah, Quartermaster of the Scavenger's guild.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_5_Quartermaster_NPC=We don't have a seat in there, but…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_6_Quartermaster_NPC=…they all know exploring the Badlands without us would be a bad idea.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_7_Quartermaster_NPC=That's why you should stop by our headquarters downtown.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_8_Quartermaster_NPC=You'll need our services, I'm sure.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_9_Any_Default=Is that… compulsory?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_10_Quartermaster_NPC=No, but you'll find our services useful. Everyone does.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_11_Quartermaster_NPC=Did lord Carran not tell you?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_12_Any_Default=No - he pretty much stuck to giving orders.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_13_Quartermaster_NPC=Ah, right. Anyway, we offer plenty of help and advice to beginners like you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_14_Joker_Default=We are grown-ups, you know. At least, most of us are.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_15_Quartermaster_NPC=Of course you are. Well, good luck!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_16_Lowlife_Default=At least she's not another lady or something.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_17_Lawkeeper_Default=Scavengers, eh? I never knew if they were legit or not.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_18_Sellsword_Default=They're tough, these Scavengers. Fearless.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_19_Highclass_Default=Inviting beggars to the Council? How peculiar.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_20_Acolyte_Default=I'd rather visit the temple, honestly.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_21_Nosy_Default=The Scavengers! They've seen so much already - the first explorers of the ancient empire!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_22_Authority_Default=So what do you think? Should we check out their headquarters?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_23_Pragmatism_Default=It's not far, but…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_24_Violence_Default=I've had enough talking - let's go kill some monsters!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_01_25_Greed_Default=If there's business to be done, we can't afford not to!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Quartermaster_NPC=Ah - you came!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Any_Default=You piqued our curiosity. So - what exactly do you have to offer?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Quartermaster_NPC=You don't know? Tsk.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Pragmatic_WRITTEN=What help do you offer?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_NosyAuthority_WRITTEN=Do you know Arwin Merton?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Selfpres_WRITTEN=Do you sell healing potions?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Default_WRITTEN=See you later.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Pragmatic_Default=What kind of help do you offer to people like us?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Quartermaster_NPC=Simple. Now, people like you typically carry out missions for the Council…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_9_Quartermaster_NPC=…in the Marches, even the Badlands. Sometimes far away, like Captain Merran.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_10_NosyAuthority_Default=Who's Captain Merran?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_11_Quartermaster_NPC=You really must be new. She's one of yours: Senior Deputy of the Council.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_12_Quartermaster_NPC=Anyway - you trek out to some old ruin in the Badlands, kill a bunch of orcs…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_13_Quartermaster_NPC=…well, you're still a bit green, so let's say goblins.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_14_Joker_Default=Ouch! You're hurting our feelings!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_15_Quartermaster_NPC=Orcs will hurt more than your feelings, believe me.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_16_Quartermaster_NPC=And stop interrupting! It's rude.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_17_Quartermaster_NPC=So let's say you find yourself with a whole load of rusty swords, leather armor, shields…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_18_Quartermaster_NPC=…too much for you to lug back here.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_19_Joker_Default=Oh - so we're puny as well as green? Thanks so much!
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_20_Quartermaster_NPC=So instead, you brave heroes just clear the place of monsters and draw us a nice, clean map.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_21_Quartermaster_NPC=Then we take our carts and pick up every piece of junk…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_22_Quartermaster_NPC=…we bring it back, we sell it, and we split the profits with you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_23_Quartermaster_NPC=We move the stuff, you go off to kill more bad things, everybody wins.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_24_Joker_Default=For a percentage, of course.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_25_Quartermaster_NPC=What? You could never carry it all, anyway.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_26_Quartermaster_NPC=Not in your little backpacks.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_27_NosyAuthority_Default=Do you know Arwin Merton, the so-called First Scavenger?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_28_Quartermaster_NPC=Of course.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_29_NosyAuthority_Default=That's it?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_30_Quartermaster_NPC=Merton… it's a painful topic for me.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_31_Quartermaster_NPC=I'd rather not talk about him.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_32_Friendly_Default=Fair enough.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_33_Selfpres_Default=Do you sell healing potions?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_34_Quartermaster_NPC=No, we don't. There's a shop for that.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_35_Quartermaster_NPC=However…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_36_Quartermaster_NPC=We've got something even better.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_37_Quartermaster_NPC=Say one of you gets killed out there in the Badlands.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_38_Joker_Default=Here we go again…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_39_Quartermaster_NPC=Normally, you'd have to come back in a hurry to get them raised.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_40_Quartermaster_NPC=Instead, you tell us about your misfortune, and we'll go get your friend's body.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_41_Quartermaster_NPC=We take it to a cleric we know, and praise be! He raises your friend from the dead.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_42_Quartermaster_NPC=It's a flat fee, and very reasonably priced.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_43_Quartermaster_NPC=Not a comfortable subject, I know. Perish the thought and so on - but it happens.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_44_Greed_Default=That's not cheap, I'm sure.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_45_Quartermaster_NPC=Well… it's risky, and clerics need pretty gemstones for these spells… but can you really put a price on peace of mind?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_46_Authority_Default=Well, thank you. I guess that's it for us.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_47_Quartermaster_NPC=Fine. Feel free to visit us anytime. Or drop into any Scavenger camp.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_48_Nosy_Authority_Default=Are there others?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_49_Quartermaster_NPC=Anywhere we can settle.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_50_Quartermaster_NPC=By the way, if you find Captain Henrik, tell him we're still interested.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_51_Authority_Default=In what?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_52_Quartermaster_NPC=In getting our people to Caer Lem.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_53_Quartermaster_NPC=The outpost is perfect for us. Close to the Badlands, with plenty of space for our camp.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_54_Authority_Default=Right, we'll tell him if we find him.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_55_Quartermaster_NPC=That would be appreciated.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_56_Quartermaster_NPC=The more you do for us, the more we do for you.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_57_Greed_Default=Oh? So this… business relationship can get better?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_58_Quartermaster_NPC=And I hope it will, friend.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_59_Any_Default=I guess we'll see you around, then.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_60_Quartermaster_NPC=Sure. Good luck out there, and don't forget - in the Badlands, always keep your eyes open.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival1_Starter_Noflag=So that's Caer Lem?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival2_Partner_Noflag=We're almost there… it's just up the hill.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival3_SelfPres_Noflag=It's a little too quiet, don't you think?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival4_Pragmatism_Slang=We're in the Marches, so quiet can't be trusted.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival5_SelfPres_Normal=True. Let's keep our eyes open.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival6_SelfPres_Formal=Quite so. We must be on our guard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival7_Authority_Normal=Eyes up and hands on hilts, people. These are the Marches.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival8_Authority_Formal=Hold formation, all! The Marches are full of perils.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival9_Selfish_Cynical_Normal=Who put you in charge?
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival10_Selfish_Cynical_Slang=Don't play the captain with me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival11_Authority_Normal=I'm just saying, be ready for anything.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival12_Authority_Formal=Simply a suggestion. I meant no offense.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival13_Default_Slang=Damn right. Let's get on with it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival14_Default_Normal=All right. Let's just keep going.
Narration/&CaerLem_Arrival15_Default_Formal=Agreed. We should press on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance16_Default_Noflag=I have a bad feeling about this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance17_Partner_Slang=Where's the garrison? Dead or run away?
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance18_Partner_Normal=There's no one here. Not even corpses.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance19_Default_Noflag=Look! That tower… that's insane!
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance20_NOSY_Noflag=Amazing! Classic Tirmarian architecture… I read about that, you know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance21_NOSY_Noflag=It just ended up here after the Cataclysm… incredible!
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance22_LUKEWARM_Slang=Courtesy of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance23_LUKEWARM_Slang=The Marches are full of stuff like this. The Badlands are worse.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance24_Cynic_Normal=I never saw a tower just stuck in a mountain like that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance25_Default_Normal=We're not in the Badlands yet, but that's a good introduction.
Narration/&CaerLem_Entrance26_Authority_law_Noflag=Anyway, we have a mission. Let's check the fortifications.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield1_Cynical_Formal=Well, that's not a good sign.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield2_Cynical_Normal=Does this tell us anything we don't already know?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield3_Pragmatic_Normal=The blood isn't that fresh, but even vultures would have left some bones behind.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield4_Pragmatic_Formal=There's enough blood here to suggest that the whole garrison was massacred.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield5_Any_Normal=Maybe it was the goblins… they took the soldiers and… ate them?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield6_Pragmatic_Normal=Those goblins were only a handful… A fifty-strong garrison would have made mincemeat of them.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectBattlefield7_Any_Normal=Well then, I'm out of ideas. Let's keep looking around.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside27_Pragmatism_Noflag=There's definitely been fighting here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside28_cynicWISECRACKER_Noflag=Why did we take this job again? Oh, yeah… these lovely Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside29_cynicWISECRACKER_Formal=No one here to greet us? How rude! I was hoping for drinks, at least.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside30_Authority_React=This is no time for jokes.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside31_Selfpres_Noflag=Right. Whoever did this could still be around, and we don't want them hearing us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Inside32_Helpful_Noflag=We should look for survivors. Fifty people can't just vanish.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem33_Starter_Normal=Did you see that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem34_Starter_Slang=What the heck was that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem35_Partner_Default=Someone's hiding inside the tower.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem36_Self_Pres_Default=It's a trap! The goblins killed everyone, and now it's our turn!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem37_Helpful_Default=Or they're the survivors, and they're being cautious.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem38_Pragmatism_Default=We need to get up to that door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem39_Selfpres_Default=That won't be easy. These walls are falling apart.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem40_Violence_Default=If they slaughtered the garrison, they'll pay!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem41_Beryl_NPC=Back off! No closer!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem42_Starter_Default=Who's there?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem43_Robar_NPC=We're not letting you in!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem44_Beryl_NPC=And we're not coming out!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem47_Starter_Default=Is Captain Henrik there? We need to talk to him!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem48_Beryl_NPC=Don't you dare speak his name, you filthy bastard!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem49_Robar_NPC=Don't talk to them!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem50_Lisbath_NPC=They'll cast a spell on you!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem51_Beryl_NPC=Don't touch me!
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem52_Pragmatism_Normal=Is something not right in there, or is it just me?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem53_Pragmatism_Slang=Lost their minds, the lot of 'em.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem54_Pragmatism_Formal=Clearly their distressing experience has affected their reason.
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem55_Joker_Normal=Filthy bastard'. Should we write that down in our report?
Narration/&CaerLem_Seenthem56_Joker_Slang=That's our report, then: they've all gone crazy. Mystery solved.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego78_Practical_Default=Let's get to the door. Maybe if they can see us up close…
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego79_Practical_Default=…we can show them our Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego1_Robar_NPC=They're here!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego2_Beryl_NPC=You damn Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego3_Starter_Default=Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego4_Partner_Default=Did they say Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego5_Starter_Slang=Ooh, they spotted it… we're shapeshifters from another world! Guess we'll have to go home now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego6_Starter_Normal=You can't be serious! Soraks are a legend for scaring children.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego7_Beryl_NPC=You bastards took the Captain, but you won't take us!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego8_Robar_NPC=Don't talk to them!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego9_Choice_1_WRITTEN=We're Council deputies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego10_Choice_2_WRITTEN=Use spy call phrase
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego11_Choice_3_WRITTEN=Use sellsword experience
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego12_Choice_4_WRITTEN=Be reasonable!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego13_Authority_Normal=We're deputies of the Council, sent by Protector Leira Kean!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego14_Beryl_FailedCheck=Nice to meet you… I'm Princess Ceiwad. Get lost!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego15_Lisbath_FailedCheck=Open the damn door, there are only four of them.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego16_Robar_SuccessCheck=They have Council badges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego17_Beryl_SuccessCheck=Sure. Of course they do! Looted from whose corpses?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego18_Spy_Default=So, sleeping in the beds of the Manacalon, are you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego19_Beryl_NPC=What?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego20_Defaulter_Default=What was that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego21_Spy_Default=Just fishing. Give it a moment.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego22_Darik_NPC=Magic pillows give us sweet dreams.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego24_Sellsword_Default=I know how you feel… I fought at Sandreed. Lost a lot of good friends there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego25_Robar_NPC=Sandreed, eh? Which unit?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego26_Beryl_NPC=What happened to "don't talk to them"?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego27_Sellsword_Default=The Longswords, under Lord Dalmore.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego28_Sellsword_Default=He died on the third day… arrow in the eye.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego29_Sellsword_Default=Jonas Mills was the real leader… fought to the bitter end.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego30_Robar_NPC=Open up… they're not Soraks.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego31_Defaulter_Default=Be reasonable and open the door. We're friendlies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego32_Beryl_NPC=Exactly what a Sorak would say.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego33_Defaulter_Default=Come on! There are just four of us… Point crossbows at us if you like.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego34_Lisbath_NPC=Let's do that! People… crossbows at the ready.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego35_Robar_NPC=Fine with me. Daliat, open the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego36_Beryl_NPC=No! I said no!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego37_Robar_NPC=Close the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego38_Starter_Default=Thank you for letting us in.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego39_Beryl_NPC=Don't thank me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_WRITTEN=Are you the officer?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_WRITTEN=You thought we were Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_WRITTEN=Can we talk to the others?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego40_Starter_Default=Are you in charge here?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego41_Beryl_NPC=Lieutenant Beryl Stonebeard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego42_Beryl_NPC=Second in command… After Captain Henrik.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego43_CynicPrag_Default=So, you really believe you were attacked by Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego44_Beryl_NPC=Man-sized lizards that can speak?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego45_Beryl_NPC=Oh, yeah… they're real.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego46_Starter_NPC=But we found no corpses… nothing.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego47_Beryl_NPC=We know. They took all the bodies, ours and theirs.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego48_Beryl_NPC=So no one can prove they exist.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_WRITTEN=That's awkward.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_WRITTEN=That's hard to believe.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_WRITTEN=That's garbage.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego49_Pragmatic_Normal=No proof… that's kind of awkward.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego50_Pragmatic_Formal=You realize, of course, how improbable that sounds?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego51_Pragmatic_Slang=Course they did… just to make you look crazy.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego52_Beryl_NPC=You won't laugh when they come back.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego53_Default_Default=We got here without trouble.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego54_Beryl_NPC=Then they let you in… and now you're trapped with us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego55_Starter_Default=Why would they do that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego56_Beryl_NPC=How should I know? They're Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego57_Starter_Slang=Mind if we talk to your buddies?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego58_Starter_Formal=Might we have a little chat with your comrades in arms?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego59_Starter_Normal=We'd like to talk to everyone here, if that's all right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego60_Beryl_NPC=As long as you don't try anything clever, we're good.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik1_Spy_Default=I might have a better chance with this guy… alone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_SelfpresLawful_Default=I don't like being kept in the dark.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik3_Spy_Default=I used to work in an embassy. Learned a few tricks.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik4_Starter_Default=He doesn't strike me as the diplomatic type.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik5_Mean_Default=He looks like any other beggar.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik6_Spy_Default=Come on, trust me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik7_Nosy_Default=What exactly is it between you and him?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik8_Einar_Default=We trust you to do what's best for us all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik9_Pakri_Default=Pakri watches. Don't betray her trust.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik10_Spy_Default=Leave the goddess out of this, will you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik11_Defaulter_Default=If you do then, please, be our guest.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik12_Spy_NPC=I saw a Whisperer's code carved in the door.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik13_Darik_NPC=How do you know the code?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik14_Spy_Default=I used to work for Delanim, at the embassy near the New Empire border.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik15_Darik_NPC=I see. I'm supposed to kill anyone who knows those words and isn't a Whisperer.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik16_Spy_Default=I'd appreciate if you didn't kill me, though.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik17_Darik_NPC=We'll see.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik18_Spy_Default=So, just to be sure, is any of this part of your business, or…
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik19_Darik_NPC=Wiping out a whole garrison just to get myself trapped with this bunch? No, that wasn't my plan.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik20_Spy_Default=So… Soraks? Really?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21_Darik_NPC=What can I tell you? They looked just like the stories say.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik22_Darik_NPC=The Captain betrayed us… they knew everything about our security.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik23_Darik_NPC=Even hiding their bodies is in the stories.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik24_Starter_Default=Think they're still around?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik25_Darik_NPC=Possibly.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik26_Spy_Default=Any idea what they're after?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik27_Darik_NPC=No.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik28_Spy_Default=Right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik29_Spy_Default=They'll want to talk to you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik30_Darik_NPC=Fine.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik31_Spy_Default=He's all yours.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik32_Starter_Default=So who are you, friend?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik33_Darik_NPC=Daliat Sunbird, scout.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik34_Starter_Default=Do you believe they were Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik35_Darik_NPC=Dunno. Seemed real, though.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik36_Starter_Default=What do you think they wanted?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik37_Darik_NPC=To kill us all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik38_Any_Normal=Not big on talk, eh?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik39_Any_Formal=You seem a very reluctant conversationalist.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Darik_NPC=I'm gonna rest now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik40_Alternate_Darik_NPC=I'm having a pretty bad day, so if you'll excuse me…
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik41_AnySelfpres_NPC=Is it me, or didn't he like that last question?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik42_Cynical_NPC=Nice man.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik43_Starter_Default=How about you? Did you learn anything?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik44_Spy_Default=Not much. He thinks the Soraks are real, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik45_Partner_Default=So much for your secret code.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik46_Spy_Default=Sorry to disappoint.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath1_Lisbath_NPC=Now it's my turn, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath2_Starter_Default=What do you mean?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath3_Lisbath_NPC=What is this? A murder investigation?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath4_Cynical_WRITTEN=Should it be?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath5_Defaulter_WRITTEN=Just trying to help.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath6_Authority_WRITTEN=Anything we should know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Cynical_Default=Should we be investigating?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath7_Lisbath_NPC=Maybe.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath8_Authority_Formal=You've said too much to stop now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath9_Authority_Normal=Speak up, then.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath10_Lisbath_NPC=Well, let's say this all happened after a certain expedition.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath11_Any_Normal=Go on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath12_Any_Slang=Spit it out.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath13_Any_Formal=Speak up without fear, friend.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath14_Lisbath_NPC=The scouts. They came back from a raid into the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath15_Lisbath_NPC=Found a ruin, came back with loot.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath16_Lisbath_NPC=The next day, this happens.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath17_Lisbath_NPC=Coincidence? You tell me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath18_Any_Default=The scouts, you say?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath19_Lisbath_NPC=Only one of them's still alive.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath20_Lisbath_NPC=Daliat.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath21_Any_Default=Right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath22_Defaulter_Default=We just want to help.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath23_Lisbath_NPC=Good luck with that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath24_Authority_Default=You sound worried. Anything we should know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath25_Lisbath_NPC=Get lost!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath26_Defaulter_WRITTEN=Sorry.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath27_Insight_WRITTEN=You're hiding something.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath28_Authority_WRITTEN=I don't like your tone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath29_Mean_WRITTEN=Go to hell.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath30_Defaulter_Default=No offense intended.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath31_Insight_Default=I'll take that as a yes.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath32_Authority_Default=I don't like to be insulted.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath33_Mean_Default=You go to hell, you spineless moron.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath34_Lisbath_NPC=You should work on your manners, then.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath35_Lisbath_NPC=And I don't like to be accused of… whatever.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath36_Defaulter_WRITTEN=Never mind.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath37_Persuader_WRITTEN=We started on the wrong foot.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath38_Intimidator_WRITTEN=Speak up, or else!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath39_Deceiver_WRITTEN=We know there's a traitor.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath40_Defaulter_Default=Get lost.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath41_Persuader_Default=Can we start this over?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath42_Lisbath_Success=Listen. Something's not right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath43_Lisbath_Failure=I don't think so.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath44_Intimidator_Default=You'll tell me sooner or later. Later's more painful.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath45_Lisbath_NPC=Friends, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath46_Lisbath_NPC=Bring it on.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath47_Deceiver_Default=We know there's a traitor among you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath48_Deceiver_Default=Help us, and we'll help you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath49_Lisbath_Success=I… I knew it. It's Daliat, right?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath50_Lisbath_NPC=Shh! He's looking at us!
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath51_Lisbath_NPC=I'll tell you what.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath52_Lisbath_Failure=You think you can fool me that easily?
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath53_Lisbath_NPC=I don't buy it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Lisbath55_AsAYes=You must have a hearing problem, then.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar1_Starter_Default=Hey, there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Starter_Formal=Greetings, soldier.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar3_Robar_NPC=Aye.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar4_Robar_NPC=Name's Robar Sharp.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar5_Starter_Normal=Sounds like you're the most experienced here, Robar.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar6_Starter_Formal=I gather you are a veteran of long standing?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar7_Starter_Slang=So you're the old sweat of the group, huh?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar8_Robar_NPC=Yeah. But I'm not in charge, mind you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar9_Starter_Default=Tell us about Stonebeard.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar10_Partner_Default=Tell us about Daliat.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Commentator_Default=Tell us about Lisbath.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar11_Reactor_Default=What should we do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar12_Sellsword_Default=Mercenary small talk
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar13_Partner_Default=This Lieutenant Stonebeard… is she up to the job?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar14_Robar_NPC=Clearly not. Look around.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar15_Robar_NPC=Losing the captain broke her.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar16_Partner_Default=What do you think of Daliat?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar17_Robar_NPC=Never liked him. He's hiding something.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar18_Robar_NPC=He's been nervous since we came back from the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar19_Robar_NPC=But it'd be no good picking a fight with him now…
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar20_Starter_Formal=Very wise.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Starter_Normal=I understand.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Commentator_Default=How about Lisbath? You're her superior?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Robar_NPC=Good woman. Strong, brave.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_NPC=You can trust her with a sword…
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_NPC=…that's worth something in my book.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Sellsword_Default=So you fought at Sandreed too?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Robar_NPC=Oh, yeah. Got the scars from rebel arrows to prove it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Sellsword_NPC=Oh, those damned skirmishers! They gave me a few holes, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Sellsword_Default=Well, if we survived Sandreed, we'll both make it through this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar30_Robar_NPC=That's the plan.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Starter_Default=So what do you think we should do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar31_Robar_NPC=For starters, not wait in here for the Soraks to come back and off us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar32_Sellsword_Default=But Stonebeard says stay, and she's an officer, so… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar33_Sellsword_Default=Yeah. She's a stubborn one, and mutiny's a bad look on a soldier.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar34_Robar_NPC=You could talk to her, deputy of the Council and all.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar35_Sellsword_Default=So if we find a way, you're with us?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar36_Starter_Default=I'm with myself. But don't let that stop you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal1_Authority_Normal=Right… we need to make a decision here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal2_Authority_Formal=It's clear that something must be done.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal3_Einar_Normal=The Soraks are real? It's a lot to take in.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal4_Einar_Formal=I'm shocked by the thought that Soraks might be real.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal5_Mean_Slang=They're either crazy or stupid… no use to us in either case.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal6_Cynical_Normal=We have enough to make our report to the Council, so let's get going.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal7_Cynical_Formal=They can't help themselves or anyone else. We should return to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal8_Cynical_Slang=Let 'em rot. We're supposed to bring back Henrik, not them.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal9_Helpful_Normal=If we don't help them, they'll either die or kill each other.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal10_Violent_Normal=Let them. Could be fun to watch.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal11_Selpres_Normal=This place is a death trap, we should get out while we can.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal12_Defaulter_Normal=So everyone has an opinion… but what are we going to do?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal13_Defaulter_Normal=And what about Daliat? We got some pretty worrying hints about him.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal14_Defaulter_Normal=What if he really is hiding something important?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal15_Authority_WRITTEN=We confront him.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal16_Violent_WRITTEN=He might be a traitor.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal17_Default_WRITTEN=It's just gossip.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal18_Selfpres_WRITTEN=Let's not risk a fight.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal19_Authority_Normal=We need to talk to him, find out the truth.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal20_Violent_Answer=If he's a traitor, we can't look the other way.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal21_Default_Answer=It's just paranoia, or personal grudges.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal22_Selfpres_Answer=If we accuse him, it might end in blood.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal23_Default_Answer=That leaves us with the others. What's our strategy?
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal24_Autority_WRITTEN=We take the lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal25_Selpres_WRITTEN=We get out of here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal26_Default_WRITTEN=Let's talk to them all together.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal27_Cynicsm_WRITTEN=We push Sharp to mutiny.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal28_Authority_Answer=We tell Stonebeard we're in charge, and take them home.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal29_Selpres_Answer=We get the hell out of here. They can either follow or stay here to die.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal30_Default_Answer=Let's just get them together and discuss this.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal31_Cynicsm_Answer=We tell Sharp to challenge Stonebeard, with our support.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal32_Any_Reaction=All right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal33_Any_Reaction=I'm not sure, but… fine.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal34_Any_Reaction=Agreed.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal35_Any_Reaction=I don't think that's a good idea.
Narration/&CaerLem_Internal36_Any_Reaction=We can't do that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik201_Starter_Default=We need to talk.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik202_Darik_NPC=Do we?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice1_WRITTEN=Not now.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_WRITTEN=You were with an expedition recently.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik2_Choice2_bailout=Well… maybe later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik203_Starter_Formal=Word is you took part in an expedition to the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik204_Starter_Normal=About this trip to the Badlands.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik205_Darik_NPC=That's what we do, here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik206_Starter_Default=The Soraks attacked after you came back.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik207_Darik_NPC=So what - I brought them here?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik208_Whisperer_Default=Listen, colleague… you can trust me.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik209_Darik_NPC=You, maybe… but the others?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik210_Starter_Default=Did you bring something back?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik211_Darik_NPC=We always do, like the Scavengers.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik212_Darik_NPC=Ask Sharp, he has tons of things brought back from there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik213_Starter_Default=But maybe this time, you took something special.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik214_Darik_NPC=It's nothing of value to Soraks!
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik215_Starter_Default=How would you know?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik216_Whisperer_Default=Show me, colleague.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik217_Persuader_Default=Just trust us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik218_Intimidate_Default=We could simply take it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik219_Deceiver_Default=We can pay for it.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik220_Defaulter_Default=We're not blaming you, but we need to know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik221_Darik_NPC=It's just an old book… might be of historical value.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik222_Darik_NPC=Take it, then. And find a way to get us out of here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik223_Deceiver_Default=The Council will reward you if you help us.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik224_Darik_NPC=You won't buy me with words.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik225_Intimidate_Default=Show us, or we'll help ourselves.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik226_Darik_NPC=I don't think so.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik227_Darik_NPC=No.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik228_Persuade=Trust us. We're all on the same side here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik229_Default_NPC=We just need to know.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik230_Darik_NPC=Hey, what's that? Hey!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_0_Salutations=Hey, there!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_1_Salutations=Deputies.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_WRITTEN=Never mind.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice2_WRITTEN=We want you to take the lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar2_Choice1_Bailout=Never mind. We'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_End6_Robar_NPC=Aye.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar21_Authority_Normal=Robar, we want you to take over from Beryl.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar22_Robar_NPC=She'll refuse.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar23_Authority_Normal=We'll back you up. She won't have a choice.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar24_Robar_Refuse_NPC=No can do… it won't work.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar25_Robar_Refuse_NPC=Right, but you deal with her if she gets mad.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar26_Beryl_NPC=What's that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar27_Authority_Normal=We believe Robar should assume command of your… remaining garrison.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar28_Beryl_NPC=Him? Just like that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar29_Authority_Normal=We order it, as deputies of the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar210_Lisbath_NPC=Bullshit.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar211_Robar_NPC=Told ya.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar212_Authority_Normal=Step down, Lieutenant, that's an order.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar213_Beryl_NPC=In your dreams!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar214_Beryl_NPC=He'll get you killed.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar215_Cynic_Normal=She took that well.
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar216_Any_Normal=So boss, what's the plan?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar217_Any_Formal=Right then, what do you say, officer?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar218_Robar_NPC=What the… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar219_Robar_LisbathAttacked=Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_Robar220_Robar_BerylAttacked=Lieutenant!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl21_Authority_Default=Can we talk?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl22_Beryl_NPC=What now?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_WRITTEN=We'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice2_WRITTEN=You should step down.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_bailout=Sorry, we'll come back later.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl2_Choice1_beryl=You do that.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl23_Authority_Default=You need to step down.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl24_Beryl_NPC=Oh? And why is that?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl25_Authority_Normal=This command… this situation… is clearly too much for you.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl26_Authority_Formal=Without wishing to cause offense, you simply lack the experience this situation requires.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl27_Authority_Slang=Because you're no damn use… that's why!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl28_Persuasion_NPC=You think I'm happy to be in charge of this mess?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl29_Intimidation_WRITTEN=We are taking command.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl210_Persuasion_WRITTEN=Robar should lead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl211_Highclass_WRITTEN=Your ancestors would agree.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl212_Intimidation_Default=We are relieving you of command, in the name of the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl213_Beryl_NPC=You… well… chain of command, I suppose.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl214_Beryl_NPC=Fine… you get us out of this, deputies!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl215_Beryl_NPC=Go boil your head!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl216_Persuasion_Default=Robar Sharp will command in your stead.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl217_Beryl_NPC=A former sellsword? There's a reason he's not an officer.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl218_Persuasion_Default=He's capable enough.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl219_Sellsword_Default=Mind your words.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl220_Highclass_Default=Your noble ancestors wouldn't like you to die rotting in there.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl221_Beryl_NPC=Maybe you're right.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl222_Beryl_NPC=I can't believe you're doing this to me!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl223_Any_Formal=How dare you?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl224_Any_Slang=Go boil your head!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl225_Any_Normal=I don't like your tone.
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_NPC=Hey, what's that… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl227_Beryl_RobarAttacked=Robar!
Narration/&CaerLem_Beryl226_Beryl_LisbathAttacked=Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled1_Beryl_NPC=You've got some explaining to do…
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled2_Starter_Default=Daliat was hiding this from you.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled3_Authority_Formal=We believe it may have attracted the Soraks.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled4_Authority_Normal=That's probably why they attacked.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled5_Any_Default=He refused to let it go, despite the danger.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled6_Robar_NPC=I'm not surprised.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled7_Lisbath_NPC=Me neither.
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled8_Beryl_NPC=That's it? So when it's your turn to be killed, I should just say that?
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled9_Robar_NPC=Wait… what… ?
Narration/&CaerLem_DaliatKilled10_Robar_NPC=Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled1_Lisbath_NPC=Robar, no!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled2_Beryl_NPC=I'm sorry…
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled3_Lisbath_NPC=You… this is all your fault…
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled4_Violence_Default=Soldiers die. You should know that.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled5_Maraike_Default=Maraike will take his soul to peace.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled6_Einar_Default=Don't be fooled, the Soraks are responsible…
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled7_Einar_Default=…and many others will fall if we don't report to the Council.
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled8_Jugdmental_Default=Don't you think it's time to stop bickering?
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled9_Lisbath_NPC=You people - just leave me alone!
Narration/&CaerLem_RobarKilled10_Beryl_NPC=You can't do that!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo1_Selpfresprag_Default=He came from here! Look!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo2_Any_Default=What's this? A secret passage?
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo3_Any_Default=From Imperial times…
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo4_Selpfresprag_Default=That was just a scout…
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo5_Selpfresprag_Default=…more will be coming.
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo6_Default=They're here!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo7_Default=They're coming back! Outside!
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo8_Selfpres_Prag_Default=We need to go! Take your stuff.
Narration/&CaerLem_TimeToGo9_Selfpres_Prag_Default=Into the secret passage, before it's too late!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled1_Robar_NPC=Lisbath!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled2_Beryl_NPC=I'm sorry…
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled3_Robar_NPC=I should have…
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled4_Sellsword_Default=Stay with us, brother. We're not the enemy.
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled5_Robar_NPC=Soraks…
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled6_Beryl_NPC=Right. Who's crazy now?
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled7_Einar_Default=We must alert the Council!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled8_Selfpres_Normal=We need to get out of here, that's what we need!
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled9_Selfpres_Formal=Surviving is what matters now.
Narration/&CaerLem_LisbathKilled10_Authority_Normal=Look at that skin! It's unbelievable…
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled1_Lisbath_NPC=Oh, no…
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled2_Robar_NPC=You know she had it coming. She failed us.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled3_JudgmentalAny_Default=Happy now?
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled4_Robar_NPC=We didn't do this… the… Sorak did.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled5_Pragmatic_Default=Right, then. They are real.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled6_Einar_Default=This is unbelievable! The Council must know!
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled7_Selfpres_Default=And we need to leave, or we'll be next.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled8_Jugdmental_Default=This could have been avoided if you people hadn't wasted time bickering.
Narration/&CaerLem_BerylKilled9_Logical_Default=Let's focus here. We can't save her now, but we can still save ourselves.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Starter_Default=Seems quiet.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Selfpres_Default=We must be cautious. Other Soraks might be scouting these caves.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Partner_Default=Hey, where's Daliat?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Starter_Default=He was here a moment ago.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Selfpres_Default=The Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Beryl_NPC=Daliat always had his own secrets.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Beryl_NPC=I think he just went his own way.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Starter_Default=And the others are in the tower looking for that secret door. We don't have much choice… let's move!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Beryl_NPC=Wait…
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel1_Robar_NPC=Wait…
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel2_Starter_Normal=Think they're Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel3_Starter_Formal=Are those Soraks?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4_Cynicism_Default=Who else?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel5_Violence_Default=We can surprise them.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel6_Selfpres_Default=Can't we sneak around?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel7_Prag_Default=From what I see, not a chance.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel8_Violence_Default=All right. Tread lightly, and we all attack at once.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort1_Starter_Default=What do you think?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort2_Stonecunning_Default=Typical Manacalon architecture…
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort3_Stonecunning_Default=…the stonecutting is textbook…
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort4_Stonecunning_Default=…using this orange stone from the mountain.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Default=That's it? Orange stone?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort5_Starter_Formal=Is that all? Stone?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Default=I'm not answering that.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort6_Stonecunning_Formal=I won't dignify that question with an answer.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort7_dunno=Maybe a dwarf could tell you about stone.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort8_dunno=I guess it's… good stone.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectFort9_dunno=Well, that was enlightening.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter1_Starter_Normal=What's this?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter2_Starter_Formal=What is this thing?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter3_Arcane_Normal=I think it was a Minor Gate.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter4_Arcane_Formal=I believe this was called a minor Imperial Gate.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter5_Arcane_Default=At its height, the Manacalon Empire had countless Gates like this.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter6_Arcane_Default=To magically travel through the Empire.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter7_Partner_Default=I don't suppose it still works?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter8_Arcane_Default=Some say there are still functioning Gates.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter9_Commentator_Default=And this plaque? Any value?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTeleporter10_Arcane_Default=Maybe. The Tower of Knowledge? Why not?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse1_Starter_Default=This one didn't die yesterday.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse2_Partner_Default=What's this outfit?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse3_History_Default=Tirmarian.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse4_Selfpres_Default=Who wants to open this?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectCorpse5_Greed_Default=You never know, there might be a fortune in there.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian1_Starter_Default=Can anyone read that?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian2_History_Default=It's old Tirmarian.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian3_History_Default=It looks like part of an inquisitor's outfit.
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian4_Partner_Default=So that's from… the tower up there?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian5_Starter_Default=Maybe we're inside the tower?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian6_Greed_Default=Is that gold?
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian7_History_Default=This is history. History, all around us!
Narration/&CaerLem_InspectTirmarian8_Prag_Default=Take it and let's move! The Soraks don't care about history, I'm sure.
Narration/&CaerLem_End1_Starter_Default=We're safe!
Narration/&CaerLem_End2_Partner_Default=We still have to go back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&CaerLem_End3_Commentator_Default=The road isn't far.
Narration/&CaerLem_End4_Starter_Normal=We'll see you back there, all right? You'll be okay?
Narration/&CaerLem_End5_Starter_Formal=I suppose we'll meet again in Caer Cyflen? Are you good to return by yourselves?
Narration/&CaerLem_End7_Beryl_NPC=Of course.
Narration/&CaerLem_End8_Daliat_NPC=Sure.
Narration/&CaerLem_End9_Lisbath_NPC=Yeah.
Narration/&Council01_1_NPC_Carran=Oh, here you are!
Narration/&Council01_2_NPC_Carran=How was the mission?
Narration/&Council01_3_Any_Practical=Successful.
Narration/&Council01_4_Any_Exalted=You won't believe it!
Narration/&Council01_5_Any_Cynical=We almost died!
Narration/&Council01_6_Any_ReligionEinar=We must report to the Council immediately.
Narration/&Council01_7_Any_Greedy=Not paid enough.
Narration/&Council01_8_Any_Seenitall=Business as usual.
Narration/&Council01_9_Any_Violent=Let's say we earned a few scars.
Narration/&Council01_10_NPC_follows3_Carran=Good.
Narration/&Council01_11_NPC_follows4_Carran=Let's hope the Council does, then!
Narration/&Council01_12_NPC_follows5_Carran=Yes here you are, safe and sound.
Narration/&Council01_13_NPC_follows6_Carran=Of course. I'll inform the Council that you've returned.
Narration/&Council01_14_NPC_follows7_Carran=Who is?
Narration/&Council01_15_NPC_follows8_Carran=I appreciate your professionalism.
Narration/&Council01_16_NPC_follows8_Carran=There's no dishonor in a few scars.
Narration/&Council01_17_Any_Practical=When can we hope for an audience?
Narration/&Council01_18_NPC_Carran=It depends… tomorrow, if you're lucky.
Narration/&Council01_19_NPC_Carran=Another party came back yesterday…
Narration/&Council01_20_NPC_Carran=…and they still have to make their report, so…
Narration/&Council01_21_NPC_Carran=…maybe they'll see you both at once.
Narration/&Council01_22_Any_Practical=We have urgent news!
Narration/&Council01_23_Any_Practical_Slang=Listen, we can't wait around here! What we've got is big!
Narration/&Council01_24_Any_Practical=The outpost at Caer Lem has been attacked!
Narration/&Council01_25_Any_Practical=Almost all of the garrison was killed!
Narration/&Council01_26_NPC_Carran=By all the gods!
Narration/&Council01_27_NPC_Carran=Meet me in the Council chamber.
Narration/&Council01_28_NPC_Carran=I'll inform my superiors.
Narration/&Council01_29_Any_ReligionEinar=This cannot wait!
Narration/&Council01_30_Any_ReligionEinar=The Caer Lem outpost was attacked by the Soraks!
Narration/&Council01_31_Any_ReligionEinar=Almost all of the garrison was killed!
Narration/&Council01_32_NPC_Carran=Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_33_NPC_Carran=Is that a joke?
Narration/&Council01_34_Any_Other=I'm afraid not.
Narration/&Council01_35_Any_Other_slang=We saw them… with our own eyes!
Narration/&Council01_36_NPC_Carran=Well, if you want to bring that to the Council…
Narration/&Council01_37_NPC_Carran=…that's your decision.
Narration/&Council01_38_NPC_Carran=If you're so eager to look like idiots…
Narration/&Council01_39_NPC_Carran=Meet me in the Council chamber.
Narration/&Council01_40_NPC_Speaker=The Legacy Council is now in session.
Narration/&Council01_41_NPC_Speaker=Captain Heather Merran has the floor.
Narration/&Council01_42_NPC_Ed_Morgan=Ladies and gentlemen… your Royal Highness…
Narration/&Council01_43_NPC_Ed_Morgan=…my party and I have made a very worrying discovery.
Narration/&Council01_44_NPC_Ed_Morgan=In the Badlands…
Narration/&Council01_45_NPC_Ed_Morgan=…near the place we call Black Hill…
Narration/&Council01_46_NPC_Ed_Morgan=…we saw a group that we took to be Scavengers.
Narration/&Council01_47_NPC_Ed_Morgan=They attacked us right away…
Narration/&Council01_48_NPC_Ed_Morgan=…but we were able to fight them off.
Narration/&Council01_49_NPC_Ed_Morgan=They were trying to get away with this.
Narration/&Council01_50_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir=What is it?
Narration/&Council01_51_NPC_Ed_Morgan=This box contains a gem… A ruby, it would appear.
Narration/&Council01_52_NPC_Ed_Morgan=We have determined that it has magical properties…
Narration/&Council01_53_NPC_Ed_Morgan=…and we believe the Council should examine it.
Narration/&Council01_54_NPC_Danantar=So we will, captain, but really…
Narration/&Council01_55_NPC_Danantar=…is that all?
Narration/&Council01_56_NPC_Danantar=You called an emergency meeting of the Council for a simple magical gem?
Narration/&Council01_57_NPC_Danantar=Her Royal Highness has a busy schedule…
Narration/&Council01_58_NPC_Princess=Please, Lord Danantar, in this chamber I'm just a student of magic.
Narration/&Council01_59_NPC_Danantar=Hear, hear!
Narration/&Council01_60_NPC_Danantar=Anyway, Captain, the Council has a great deal of business…
Narration/&Council01_61_NPC_Ed_Morgan=They were Soraks, our attackers… not Scavengers, not bandits… Soraks!
Narration/&Council01_62_NPC_Danantar=…
Narration/&Council01_63_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir=Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_64_NPC_Tower_Faisech=Is this a joke?
Narration/&Council01_65_NPC_Einar=The Sorr-Akkath are no laughing matter, Lord Faisech!
Narration/&Council01_66_NPC_Tower_Faisech=Oh, you know what I mean.
Narration/&Council01_67_NPC_Princess=What do you mean, my lord?
Narration/&Council01_68_NPC_Tower_Faisech_Faisech=How many times has the Council heard tales of these so-called Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_69_NPC_Antiquarian_Gormsdottir=At least twenty, I'd say.
Narration/&Council01_70_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze=More. Twenty-three.
Narration/&Council01_71_NPC_Danantar=More each year. It's becoming a fad.
Narration/&Council01_72_NPC_Tower_Faisech=I'm sorry, Captain, but… you are certain that you encountered Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_73_PlayerChoice_Default=We did, too!
Narration/&Council01_74_PlayerChoice_Exalted=It's true! They're real!
Narration/&Council01_75_PlayerChoice_Authoritative=If you doubt her word, you can trust ours! We fought Soraks ourselves!
Narration/&Council01_76_PlayerChoice_Practical=She's telling the truth!
Narration/&Council01_77_NPC_Tower_Faisech=What?
Narration/&Council01_78_NPC_Tower_Faisech=And who might you be?
Narration/&Council01_79_NPC_LeiraKean=Some new recruits, my lord. They were sworn in quite recently.
Narration/&Council01_80_NPC_Tower_Faisech=New recruits, eh? They place too much stock in rumor, it seems.
Narration/&Council01_81_NPC_LeiraKean=They assure me that they saw Soraks as well.
Narration/&Council01_82_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze=Wait!
Narration/&Council01_83_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze=Do you realize how serious this is?
Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1_WRITTEN=We do.
Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2_WRITTEN=We saw them.
Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3_WRITTEN=They attacked Caer Lem.
Narration/&Council01_84_PlayerChoice_1=We do.
Narration/&Council01_85_PlayerChoice_2=The Soraks are real! We saw them… we fought them!
Narration/&Council01_86_PlayerChoice_3=They attacked the Caer Lem outpost… the garrison suffered severe losses!
Narration/&Council01_87_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_1=We have never had two sightings reported at the same time.
Narration/&Council01_88_NPC_Tower_Faisech_1=Pah! Does that make this nonsense more believable?
Narration/&Council01_89_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_2=Two sightings - independent witnesses! When will you see the truth?
Narration/&Council01_90_NPC_Morgan_2=Yes, sir!
Narration/&Council01_91_NPC_Morgan_2=Reptilians… fast, strong…
Narration/&Council01_92_PlayerSelection_Authoritative=…they can climb on walls just like spiders!
Narration/&Council01_93_PlayerSelection_Default=…they're tough, too!
Narration/&Council01_94_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3=Caer Lem? The outpost in the Marches?
Narration/&Council01_95_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze_3=What do you mean by heavy losses?
Narration/&Council01_96_PlayerSelection_Authoritative=The Soraks took over captain Henrik…
Narration/&Council01_97_PlayerSelection_Authoritative=…and only two of them are still alive.
Narration/&Council01_98_PlayerSelection_Authoritative=They can testify, too.
Narration/&Council01_99_NPC_Gormsdottir=Do you have any… material proof of their existence?
Narration/&Council01_100_PlayerSelection_Authoritative=I beg your pardon?
Narration/&Council01_101_NPC_Morgan=Like what?
Narration/&Council01_102_NPC_Tower_Faisech=Well… A dead body, for example!
Narration/&Council01_103_NPC_Tower_Faisech=Or even just a head?
Narration/&Council01_104_NPC_Einar=If we go to Caer Lem, will we find the bodies of these Soraks?
Narration/&Council01_105_PlayerSelection_Authoritative=Probably not.
Narration/&Council01_106_NPC_Morgan=They took their dead with them when they retreated.
Narration/&Council01_107_PlayerSelection_Authoritative=The bodies of their victims, too.
Narration/&Council01_108_NPC_Tower_Faisech=Hm! How very convenient!
Narration/&Council01_109_NPC_Tower_Faisech=So you can offer us no proof of this…
Narration/&Council01_110_NPC_Tower_Faisech=…adventurer's fable.
Narration/&Council01_111_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze=And what if proof were to be brought before the Council?
Narration/&Council01_112_NPC_Tower_Faisech=What proof? How?
Narration/&Council01_113_NPC_Tower_Faisech=If the Soraks take away their fallen, as they say.
Narration/&Council01_114_NPC_Danantar=That's not our problem. Let them find a way.
Narration/&Council01_115_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind=These are new recruits, correct?
Narration/&Council01_116_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind=Then let this be their new mission:
Narration/&Council01_117_NPC_Arcaneum_Keenmind=Bring us the head of a Sorak, for the whole Council to see.
Narration/&Council01_118_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze=That would certainly be proof, Lord Faisech, would it not?
Narration/&Council01_119_NPC_Tower_Faisech=Oh, very well. Meanwhile, the Council will examine the gem.
Narration/&Council01_120_NPC_Tower_Faisech=If there is nothing else?
Narration/&Council01_121_NPC_Speaker=Dean Iolair Faisech of the Tower of Knowledge calls for a recess!
Narration/&Council01_122_NPC_Speaker=Does any member object?
Narration/&Council01_123_NPC_Speaker=No? It is resolved, then! The Legacy Council is now in recess!
Narration/&Council01_124_NPC_Carran=That actually went better than I expected.
Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN=Who's the grumpy dwarf?
Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar_WRITTEN=We had to stand by Merran.
Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility_WRITTEN=The Princess is bland.
Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin_WRITTEN=They are seat-warmers.
Narration/&Council01_125_PlayerChoice_Cynical=Who's the grumpy dwarf woman?
Narration/&Council01_126_PlayerChoice_Einar=We had to stand by Merran… We know she speaks the truth.
Narration/&Council01_127_PlayerChoice_Nobility=I must say, the Princess was… not what I expected.
Narration/&Council01_128_PlayerChoice_Urchin=They're just a bunch of politicking seat-warmers, for all their airs and graces.
Narration/&Council01_129_NPC_Carran=Chancellor Hertha Gormsdottir, of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Narration/&Council01_130_NPC_Carran=She's… Well, yes. Quite.
Narration/&Council01_131_NPC_Carran=I'm sure she will appreciate your support.
Narration/&Council01_132_NPC_Carran=Oh? And what did you expect, exactly?
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical_WRITTEN=Someone older.
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Highclass_WRITTEN=Someone… a little more presentable?
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Authority_WRITTEN=Someone more dignified.
Narration/&Council01_133_PlayerChoice_Cynical=A pretty, empty-headed girl. Oh, wait…
Narration/&Council01_134_NPC_Carran=Mind your words! She may rank low on the Council…
Narration/&Council01_135_NPC_Carran=…but she is our sovereign, and she is well loved in the Principality.
Narration/&Council01_136_PlayerChoice_Authoritative=A more… how to put it? A more commanding personality?
Narration/&Council01_137_NPC_Carran=Ah, well… she is young still. And she has many other qualities.
Narration/&Council01_138_PlayerChoice_Nobility=Someone more… regal?
Narration/&Council01_139_NPC_Carran=No one is more regal than our Princess, believe me!
Narration/&Council01_140_Player_Nobility=You know what I mean.
Narration/&Council01_141_NPC_Carran=No, actually… I don't.
Narration/&Council01_142_PlayerChoice_Urchin=A shower of weevils. Rich, clean weevils!
Narration/&Council01_143_NPC_Carran=And your employers, let's not forget.
Narration/&Council01_144_NPC_Carran=I must admit, the Legacy Council is a… complex body.
Narration/&Council01_145_NPC_Carran=Anyway…
Narration/&Council01_146_NPC_Carran=…some people might want to talk to you after this.
Narration/&Council01_147_NPC_Carran=Working for the Council, you are expected to be neutral.
Narration/&Council01_148_PlayerChoice_Default=But?
Narration/&Council01_149_NPC_Carran=But you have the right to have friends.
Narration/&Council01_150_NPC_Carran=So feel free to talk to whoever you like.
Narration/&Council01_151_NPC_Carran=As long your allegiance remains to the Council as a whole.
Narration/&Council01_152_PlayerChoice_Register_Formal=You may rely on our honor.
Narration/&Council01_153_PlayerChoice_Register_normal=Of course.
Narration/&Council01_154_PlayerChoice_Register_Slang=All right, then.
Narration/&Council01_155_Merran_Thanks01=Hey, deputies - thanks for the support in there!
Narration/&Council01_156_AnyFriendly=You're welcome, Captain.
Narration/&Council01_157_Merran_Thanks02=So, those bastards got Henrik? Shame.
Narration/&Council01_158_Curious=You knew him?
Narration/&Council01_159_Merran_Thanks03=Yes, indeed. I wonder who'll volunteer to retake Caer Lem now…
Narration/&Council01_160_Friendly=The Scavengers could lead the way.
Narration/&Council01_161_Merran_Thanks04=Yeah. They'll find a bunch of hotheads to retake the fort, I'm sure.
Narration/&Council01_162_Merran_Thanks05=Stay in the light, friends!
Narration/&Council01_163_Merran_AnyFriendly=You, too!
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_1_Beryl_NPC=Well, if it isn't our brave saviors.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_2_Any_Default=Good day, Lieutenant.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_3_Aristocrat_Formal=Salutations, Lieutenant.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_4_Beryl_NPC=I'm no longer a lieutenant. I resigned my commission. I work for my people now.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_5_Any_Default=The Snow Alliance?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_6_Beryl_NPC=I will never step foot in the Badlands again.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_7_Any_Default=I understand your reluctance.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_8_Loyalty_Normal=Yes, well, you clearly weren't cut out for that posting.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_9_Beryl_NPC=I've made my peace, but you aren't here to check on my welfare, are you?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_10_Any_Formal=No, we seek information. Before the attack, where exactly did your scout venture?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_11_Any_Normal=No, we have questions. Your scout? Do you know where he was before the attack?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_12_Beryl_NPC=You mean Daliat?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_13_Any_Formal=Yes, we'd like to know where he went before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_14_Any_Normal=Right, Daliat. Where did he go before the Soraks attacked?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_15_Beryl_NPC=As far as I know, there's not a name for that place or a road that leads there…
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_16_Beryl_NPC=But I can show you on a map. It's near the ruins of an ancient tower.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_17_Aristocrat_Formal=You have our gratitude, Lady Stonebeard.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_18_Any_Default=Thank you, Beryl. We appreciate the help.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Beryl_19_Beryl_NPC=What are you thanking me for? Sending you to your death?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_1_Daliat_NPC=Greetings, deputies.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_2_Spy_Normal=Are you ready to come clean?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_3_Any_Default=Greetings, Daliat. If that's even your name.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_4_Daliat_NPC=Of course it's my name. What are you implying?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_5_Any_Default=Nothing at all. We just want to establish who we're talking to.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_6_Daliat_NPC=Daliat Sunbird, Scout of the Council. You know who I am!
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_7_Any_Default=Then perhaps you can tell us the location of the ruin you came across right before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_8_Daliat_NPC=What do you mean?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_9_Spy_Normal=Tell us all you know and perhaps we can convince the Council to go easy on you.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_10_Daliat_NPC=Why would they need to go easy on me? I've told you all I know.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_11_Spy_Normal=You haven't told us the location of the Manacalon ruin you found right before the Soraks attacked.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_12_Daliat_NPC=I won't take you there…
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_13_Daliat_NPC=But I can show you the location on a map.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_14_Daliat_NPC=Of course, nothing is free.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_15_Any_Default=Indeed. Thank you.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_16_Daliat_NPC=I'm glad we could come to some agreement.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_17_Any_Default=As are we.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_18_Daliat_NPC=It's just business, after all.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Daliat_19_Any_Default=Right, nothing personal. Take care, Daliat.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_1_Robar_NPC=Well, look who it is. I see you survived the Council.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_2_Any_Default=We did indeed.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_3_Sellsword_Normal=Don't get your hopes up. We aren't here to offer you a job.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_4_Robar_NPC=Good, because I imagine you'd probably pay very poorly.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_5_Sellsword_Normal=You imagine correctly. I do have a question, though.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_6_Robar_NPC=To what do I owe the honor?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_7_Any_Default=We'd like to know where Daliat and his scouts ventured right before the attack.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_8_Robar_NPC=Looking for Soraks, are we?
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_9_Any_Default=Possibly.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_10_Robar_NPC=You people are crazy.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_11_Robar_NPC=Here, gimme your map and I'll pinpoint the approximate location.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_12_Robar_NPC=It's near an old ruin, an ancient tower.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_13_Any_Default=Appreciate the help, Robar.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_14_Robar_NPC=Though I may have just helped you into an early grave.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_15_Any_Default=This time we'll take them by surprise.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_16_Robar_NPC=Right. Good luck with that.
Narration/&AfterCouncil01_Robar_17_Any_Default=Farewell, Robar!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_1_Starter_Formal=What is this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_2_Starter_Normal=What's going on here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_3_Starter_Slang=What the hell did we just stumble into?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_4_Partner_Default=These aren't Soraks. They seem human.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_5_Starter_Default=What exactly are they doing?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_6_Partner_Default=What's it look like they're doing? They're digging something up.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_7_History_Slang=Just another dusty pile of rubble from before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Normal=This ruin dates back to Imperial times.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_8_History_Default=A tower of magic perhaps, owned by one of the masters of Manacalon's Arcaneum.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_9_Starter_Default=Who are these people? Scavengers?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_10_Partner_Default=Hard to say. I see no tent or flag signifying their allegiance.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_11_Authority_Default=Well, there is one way to find out.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_12_Selfpres_Default=Perhaps we should sneak a little closer.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_13_Friendliness_Default=Or simply walk in and see how friendly they are.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers01=Alert!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers02_Normal=All right - no talking, then…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicWorkers03_Formal=Looks like there won't be any parley…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_1_Starter_Default=So what do you think?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_2_Partner_Normal=Humans.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_3_Partner_Slang=They look like people to me.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_4_Partner_Formal=I see nothing to indicate they are reptilian.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_5_Partner_Normal=Unless, they have been transmogrified and are in disguise.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_6_Starter_Default=What's that symbol there?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_7_Partner_Default=The tattoo?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_8_Partner_Default=Looks like an A.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_9_Commentator_Default=They all have it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_10_Cynical_Normal=Guess they're all part of the same club.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_11_Cynical_Formal=Perhaps it's a crude marker that indicates their allegiance.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_12_Pragmatic_Default=Well, there's no reason to assume it signifies something sinister.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_13_Starter_Default=Do you think it has anything to do with the Soraks?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_14_History_Default="A" could stand for Arivad.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_15_History_Default=One of the many names of Sorr-Tarr, the Sorak God.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_16_Anyother_Default=Are you kidding me?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_17_Anyother_Default=That's not good.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_18_Starter_Default=At least we know we're in the right place.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_19_Authority_Default=Should we see what they're doing here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_20_Selpres_Default=Yes, but we should also keep an eye out for any stray Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_21_Violence_Default=If a Sorak shows up, we need to cut off its head.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_1_Starter_Default=Please don't kill me.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_2_Starter_Default=What are you doing here?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_3_Starter_Default=I'm just a worker.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_4_Starter_Default=Are you tattooed with an A?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_5_Starter_Default=I… you don't understand…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_6_Starter_Default=Are you one of them?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_7_Starter_Default=One of what? I'm just trying to survive.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_8_Starter_Default=I had no choice.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_9_Written_Kill=You must die.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_10_Written_LetLive=Get out of here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_11_Written_Tatoo=Tell us about the tattoo.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_12_Written_Imps=Are the Soraks around?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_13_Choice_Kill=He is a Sorak slave! We should put him out of his misery!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_14_Choice_LetLive=Run! Run for your life!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_15_Choice_Tatoo=What does the tattoo signify?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_16_Choice_Imps=Are the Soraks close by?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_17_Starter_Default=It's… I can't…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_18_Starter_Default=He's dead. How is that possible?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_19_Starter_Default=How is any of this possible?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_20_Starter_Default=He was doomed from the start.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_21_Starter_Default=They're here. They're close…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicLoneWorker_22_Starter_Default=If they know that I…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor1_Starter_NPC=Another statue…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor2_Partner_Normal=These guys really loved themselves.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor3_Partner_Formal=These Manacalon wizards were quite fond of themselves.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor4_History_Normal=Now, this is an Emperor.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor5_History_Normal=A famous one, too? Lerithir Imradir…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor6_History_Normal=…he was Emperor at the time of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor7_Partner_Normal=Good job managing the trouble, mister.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_StatueEmperor8_Partner_Formal=He made history, but not the way he would have wanted.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_1_Arcana_Default=This place is astounding.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_2_Partner_Default=What kind of runes are those?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_3_Arcana_Default=Enchanted runes. From the ancient Imperial period.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_4_Arcana_Default=It is said they had eight schools of magic.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_5_Arcana_Default=Each is represented here. All as equals.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_6_Pragmatic_Formal=We weren't sent here to find runes. We were sent to find Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_7_Pragmatic_Slang=Yeah, you can tell that to the Soraks right before they cut us to frickin' pieces.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicRunes_8_Pragmatic_Normal=We're not here for runes, we're here for Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_1_Starter_Default=That was… unexpected.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_2_Partner_Default=This place is topsy-turvy.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_3_Partner_Default=Magic from a time long forgotten.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_4_Joker_Default=Remind me not to take a dump in that hole.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_5_Prag_Default=Do you really have to make jokes?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_6_Joker_Default=Yeah. It's in my contract. Did Carran not tell you?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_7_FormalJoker_Default=Something funny suddenly comes to mind…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_8_Prag_Default=Can you keep it to yourself?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicReversedGravity_9_Starter_Default=Might be good to remember what these blue currents can do.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_1_Starter_Default=We did it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_2_Partner_Default=Was that insane puzzle the work of some long dead Manacalon wizard?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicDoor_3_Joke_Default=Probably. Even from the tomb that magical arsehole is messing with us.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_1_Starter_Default=They didn't die easily.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_2_Starter_Default=Worthy foes, indeed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_3_Partner_Formal=Thankfully, we prevailed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_4_Partner_Slang=Got every one of those ugly bastards.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_5_Partner_Normal=They bleed just like we do.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicAfterKillingImps_6_Pragmatic_Default=Now we just need one of their bloody heads.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_1_Commentator_Default=Would you look at this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_2_Starter_Default=A crown of some kind?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_3_Partner_Default=They seemed to keep their distance from it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_4_Selpres_Default=Maybe it's cursed.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_5_PlayerChoice_Default=Look what I found.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_6_Educated_Default=Let me take a look.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_7_Default_Default=What language is this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_8_Tirmarian_Default=Looks like ancient Tirmarian.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_9_Tirmarian_Default=If you find it, send for… this appears to be a name.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_10_Starter_Slang=Is this the language of those damned lizards?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_11_Starter_Normal=That has to be a Sorak name.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_12_Partner_Default=They were protecting it, so it must be valuable - to them, at least.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_13_Selpres_Default=Take it then.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_14_Starter_Default=Whew, I was worried it might be booby trapped.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_15_Partner_Default=Perhaps we should rest before we head back.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_16_Selpres_Default=I say we go.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_17_Selpres_Default=Before the owner of that unpronounceable name shows his ugly face.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default=The mission is done after all.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_19_Selpres_Default=Is it? Did someone cut off a Sorak's head?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_20_Selpres_Default=All right, then - I'll do it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_21_Pragmatic_Default=The sooner we go, the sooner we can get back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_22_Starter_Default=After you, friends.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrownWRITTENLINE=Take the Crown
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_1_Starter_Default=Interesting.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_2_Spellcaster_Default=It's in remarkable condition considering how long it's been here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_3_Starter_Default=Do you think it has magical properties?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_4_Spellcaster_Slang=By Arun's bones! I think it's a spellbook.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_5_Spellcaster_Default=A spellbook that predates the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_6_Starter_Default=And I should care because?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_7_Spellcaster_Formal=Who knows what it might contain.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_8_Spellcaster_Default=A long-forgotten spell. A valuable secret.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_9_Spellcaster_Default=But it looks like it's locked.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_10_Starter_Default=Take it. Perhaps someone in Caer Cyflen will know how to open it.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_11_Spellcaster_Default=First things first. We have a mission to complete.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_12_Spellcaster_Formal=Indeed, but we have more pressing matters to attend to first.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicBook_13_Spellcaster_Slang=Yeah, but right now we have more important shit to take care of.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_1_Starter_Default=Fancy.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_2_Starter_Default=Beautiful craftsmanship.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_3_Starter_Default=She looks like an empress.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_4_History_Default=She doesn't bear the proper regalia. Not for a Manacalon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_5_History_Default=More likely she was a wizard, a master of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_6_Starter_Default=Could this have been her home?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_7_History_Default=Possibly.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_8_Joker_Default=If it was, she sure let it go to hell. What a packrat.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_9_Joker_Default=Her bones are probably buried somewhere under all these frickin' books.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueFemWiz_10_Starter_Default=You are an idiot.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_1_Starter_Default=You see that?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_2_Partner_Default=Is that a Sorak?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_3_History_Default=Don't be ridiculous. This is pre-Cataclysm.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4_History_Default=Before anyone knew what a Sorak even was.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_5_History_Default=It's a dragon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_6_Starter_Default=It's no bigger than a man.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_7_Starter_Slang=No shit?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_8_Starter_Normal=If you say so.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_9_Partner_Normal=I don't think so.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_1_Starter_Default=Is this one of those rocks that…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_2_Partner_Default=Nope. This place is insane.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_3_Partner_Default=In the Badlands…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicPillar_4_Starter_Default=I know… expect the unexpected.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_1_Starter_Default=Well, that didn't do a damn thing.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_2_Cynical_Default=Did you really think that would open the door?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_3_Violence_Default=I need to break some frickin' heads!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_4_Pragmatism_Default=We need to be smarter about this. Think it through.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_5_Greed_Default=We better get out of this with some gold in our pockets.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicUselessLever_6_SelfPres_Default=Your faces are not the last faces I want to see.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_1_Starter_Default=Stay hidden. They're here.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_2_Partner_Default=Soraks?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_3_Starter_Default=What else could they be?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_4_Partner_Normal=You ready to do this?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_5_Partner_Formal=This is it, friends. Stay strong.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_6_Starter_Default=Get in position…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_7_Starter_Default=…hit 'em hard and take 'em by surprise.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicSeeingImps_8_Partner_Default=Ready.
Narration/&CrownOwned_1_Partner_Normal=You look a little pale. Is something wrong?
Narration/&CrownOwned_2_Partner_Formal=Are you feeling poorly? You seem a bit pasty-faced.
Narration/&CrownOwned_3_Bearer_Default=I don't feel too good.
Narration/&CrownOwned_4_Cynical_Selfpres_Default=I knew that old Crown was cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_5_Cynical_Selfpres_Slang=Shit, I knew that hunk of junk was cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_6_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal=Just as I feared. The crown is Cursed.
Narration/&CrownOwned_7_Partner_Default=You don't know that.
Narration/&CrownOwned_8_Cynical_Selpres_Default=Just get rid of it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_9_Cynical_Selfpres_Formal=Perhaps we should leave it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_10_Bearer_Default=No, we need it.
Narration/&CrownOwned_11_Partner_Default=Need it? For what?
Narration/&CrownOwned_12_Bearer_Default=For its power. I can feel it. Deep inside.
Narration/&CrownOwned_13_Friendly_Default=Are you okay?
Narration/&CrownOwned_14_Bearer_Default=I just need to rest for a bit.
Narration/&CrownOwned_15_Any1_Default=Yeah, I'm not feeling too good either.
Narration/&CrownOwned_16_Any2_Default=I'm exhausted as well.
Narration/&CrownOwned_17_Cynical_Selpres_Default=Maybe the curse has affected us all.
Narration/&CrownOwned_18_Partner_Default=Stop it. Don't be ridiculous.
Narration/&CrownOwned_19_Friendly_Default=Fine, let's rest for a while. Set up camp.
Narration/&CrownOwned_20_Friendly_Formal=I propose we set up camp and get some rest.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_1_Pragmatic_Default=We did it! We brought back proof!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_2_Pragmatic_Formal=Against all odds, we have recovered proof that Soraks do exist.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_3_Friendly_Default=How do you feel?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_4_Bearer_Default=Better.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_5_Friendly_Default=Maybe that sickness was nothing.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_6_Friendly_Formal=It might have been a simple fever, after all.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_7_Pragmatic_Default=What about the Crown?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_8_Pragmatic_Default=You know the Council will probably take it.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_9_Bearer_Default=No!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_10_Pragmatic_Default=We can't hide the fact that we found it with the Soraks.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_11_Pragmatic_Slang=We can't bullshit them, it's got to be a Sorak thing.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_12_Bearer_Default=It's our loot! Ours!
Narration/&BackWithCrown_13_Pragmatic_Default=We have to declare anything of historical value…
Narration/&BackWithCrown_14_Pragmatic_Default=…and they have the right to buy it.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_15_Bearer_Default=And if it's priceless?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_16_Cynical_Default=Come on! They can do whatever they want.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_17_Bearer_Default=Sure.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_18_Pragmatic_Default=I guess we'll see.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_19_Pragmatic_Formal=We must wait and see, and hope for the best.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_20_Cynical_Default=Who fought the Soraks - us or them?
Narration/&BackWithCrown_21_Cynical_Normal=They'd better remember that we fought the Soraks for this.
Narration/&BackWithCrown_22_Cynical_Formal=We might want to remind them that they were wrong about the Soraks.
Narration/&Council02_1_1_Partner_Default=Lord Carran!
Narration/&Council02_1_2_Carran_NPC=Ah - deputies!
Narration/&Council02_1_2_2_Carran_NPC=I see you found some nice shiny loot.
Narration/&Council02_1_3_Carran_NPC=So have you brought us the head of a Sorak?
Narration/&Council02_1_4_Partner_Default=One head, slightly damaged.
Narration/&Council02_1_5_Carran_NPC=Maraike preserve us! I'm sorry I asked!
Narration/&Council02_1_6_Partner_Default=At least it's dead. You should have seen it alive.
Narration/&Council02_1_7_Carran_NPC=I can only imagine.
Narration/&Council02_1_8_Partner_Default=When's the next Council meeting?
Narration/&Council02_1_9_Carran_NPC=When? Now, of course!
Narration/&Council02_1_10_Carran_NPC=The rumor of your return has already reached the Palace.
Narration/&Council02_1_11_Carran_NPC=They're waiting for you.
Narration/&Council02_1_12_Partner_Default=They are?
Narration/&Council02_1_13_Carran_NPC=Well, more for… this. But come on!
Narration/&Council02_1_14_Merton_NPC=Now, there's a trophy.
Narration/&Council02_1_15_Merton_NPC=And by the way, who's crazy now?
Narration/&Council02_1_16_Default_Default=All right, you were right and we were wrong. They do exist. Happy now?
Narration/&Council02_1_17_Merton_NPC=Kid, I've seen more than anyone in this town, yet nobody seems to believe me.
Narration/&Council02_1_18_Cynical_Default=Maybe it's a curse.
Narration/&Council02_1_19_Merton_NPC=The curse of being surrounded by idiots…
Narration/&Council02_1_20_Carran_NPC=If you don't mind, Merton, we have business to attend to.
Narration/&Council02_1_21_Merton_NPC=Right. Say hello to the old lady for me, Carran!
Narration/&Council02_1_22_Default_Default=Who's this guy again?
Narration/&Council02_1_23_Merton_NPC=Arwin Merton. He used to be a legend - the first Scavenger, they say.
Narration/&Council02_1_24_Merton_NPC=But now - well, you can see for yourself.
Narration/&Council02_1_25_Curious_Default=Who's this old lady?
Narration/&Council02_1_26_Merton_NPC=Just ignore him.
Narration/&Council02_1_27_Merton_NPC=Let's go.
Narration/&Council02_2_1_EinarBoss_NPC=Your thoughts, Dean Faisech?
Narration/&Council02_2_2_Towerboss_NPC=I… well… it looks very much as the scriptures describe.
Narration/&Council02_2_3_Danantar_NPC=Well, then - it seems we have a problem.
Narration/&Council02_2_4_EinarBoss_NPC=It's a disaster! We all know what the Sorr-Akkath did on Tirmar!
Narration/&Council02_2_5_Partner_Default=There's something else.
Narration/&Council02_2_6_Danantar_NPC=What?
Narration/&Council02_2_7_Antiquarian_NPC=A Crown?
Narration/&Council02_2_8_Towerboss_NPC=Interesting. A very nice find.
Narration/&Council02_2_9_Partner_Default=We don't want to sell it.
Narration/&Council02_2_10_Antiquarian_NPC=Why not? You know we pay well.
Narration/&Council02_2_11_Partner_Default=We want to keep it.
Narration/&Council02_2_12_Arcaneum_NPC=I'd like to take a look at it, though.
Narration/&Council02_2_13_Partner_Default=…
Narration/&Council02_2_14_Authority_Default=Come on, let them take a look.
Narration/&Council02_2_15_Arcaneum_NPC=Thank you.
Narration/&Council02_2_16_Danantar_NPC=Any ideas?
Narration/&Council02_2_17_Arcaneum_NPC=It's quite massive… clearly Imperial in style…
Narration/&Council02_2_18_Towerboss_NPC=These runes remind me of the Imperial schools of magic…
Narration/&Council02_2_19_Antiquarian_NPC=I have a spell I'd like to cast on this.
Narration/&Council02_2_20_Princess_NPC=My lords! This deputy is clearly unwell!
Narration/&Council02_2_21_Danantar_NPC=What?
Narration/&Council02_3_1_Bearer_Default=What happened?
Narration/&Council02_3_2_Friendly_Default=You passed out.
Narration/&Council02_3_3_Bearer_Default=Where are we?
Narration/&Council02_3_4_Friendly_Default=The Temple of Einar.
Narration/&Council02_3_5_Friendly_Default=Marshal Beric Sunblaze himself invited us to stay here.
Narration/&Council02_3_6_Pragmatic_Default=We certainly made an impression on the Council.
Narration/&Council02_3_7_Pragmatic_Default=They believe you're attuned to the Crown…
Narration/&Council02_3_8_Pragmatic_Default=…that you can't be separated from it.
Narration/&Council02_3_9_Bearer_Default=What? So it is cursed?
Narration/&Council02_3_10_Cynical_Default=They're not sure. All these big brains, and they're stumped.
Narration/&Council02_3_11_Cynical_Default=They cast spells on the crown, on you…
Narration/&Council02_3_12_Pragmatic_Default=Between that and the Soraks, we caused quite a fuss out there.
Narration/&Council02_3_13_Pragmatic_Default=They'll reconvene the Council when you're ready.
Narration/&Council02_3_14_Pragmatic_Default=But trust me, there's a lot of people who want to talk to you first.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=It's an honor, deputies.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default=Who are you?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_3_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=My name is Maddy Greenisle. I work for the Tower of Knowledge.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_4_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=I'm just a junior aide in the Council…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_5_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=…but if you ever need to contact my superiors without going through official channels…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=…just see me at the Tower, downtown.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Selfpres_Default=Why the sudden interest in us?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_8_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=You proved yourselves in the Badlands…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_9_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=…and we in the Tower of Knowledge value skilled adventurers.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_10_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=If you find anything of historical value, we'll pay well…
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_11_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=And if things go well, we might share some of our own secrets.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_01_12_Authority_Default=All right - we'll think about it.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_1_HalmanSummer_NPC=Greetings, Sorak slayers!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_2_Friendly_Default=Hello.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_3_HalmanSummer_NPC=I am Halman Summer of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_4_HalmanSummer_NPC=I am instructed to invite you to visit us at the Embassy of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_5_Lawfulness_Default=You're based at an embassy? I thought the Council was neutral.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_6_HalmanSummer_NPC=We don't have a house of our own in Caer Cyflen - unlike the Tower of Knowledge…
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_7_HalmanSummer_NPC=…how about that for neutrality?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_8_HalmanSummer_NPC=Anyway, we'd be interested in any antiquities you might bring back.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_9_HalmanSummer_NPC=We pay very well, even for things you might think are worthless.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_10_Cynical_Default=Like the Scavengers?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_11_HalmanSummer_NPC=The Scavengers? They'd sell an antique Emperor's sword for its metal value.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_12_HalmanSummer_NPC=But we can offer more than gold.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_13_HalmanSummer_NPC=Antique magical items, for instance. You'll never find their like elsewhere.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_01_14_Friendly_Default=Good to know. Thanks for the invitation.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Can I ask for a minute of your time, deputies?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_2_Player_Authority=We're in kind of a hurry.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=I know. I won't delay you long.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_4_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=My name is Heddlon Surespell. I represent the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_5_AnyNotElf_Default=And the Arcaneum belongs to the New Empire. Do you really want to be seen talking to us?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=My business is magic, not politics. And no, I have no quarrel with you.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=You may not see us Imperials as friends, but we take the Council very seriously.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_8_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=We are particularly interested in anything from the Old Empire that you might find in the Badlands.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Anything from the Manacalon-era Arcaneum, even more so.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_10_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Of course we'd pay you handsomely for this Crown, but I know that is not possible.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default=You're smarter than you look.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Also quite indifferent to mockery.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_13_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Anyway, we have an unrivaled trove of magical and other knowledge.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_14_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Think it over. You can find me at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_15_Lawful_Default=Really? Not at the embassy?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=What can I say? I love Martel's beer. Even though it tastes like donkey piss…
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_17_Selfpres_Default=What? How did he… ?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_18_Selfpres_Default=That was our joke, the first day we met. Was he spying on us?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_01_19_Pragmatic_Default=Maybe he just agrees about the taste.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Would you have a moment, deputies?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_2_Authority_Default=All right, but make it quick.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_3_JorielFoxeye_NPC=I'll do my best.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_4_JorielFoxeye_NPC=I am Joriel Foxeye, from the Circle of Danantar.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_5_Nosy_Default=The same magic school where the Princess studies?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_6_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Exactly.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_7_Nosy_Default=Is she a good student? A powerful wizard?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_8_JorielFoxeye_NPC=That's not for me to say - and you seemed to be in a rush?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_9_Nosy_Default=Fine.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_10_JorielFoxeye_NPC=I just want you to know that our grand master Edvan Danantar has noticed you.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_11_Joker_Default=He talked a lot, for sure.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_12_JorielFoxeye_NPC=He's a man of great authority.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_JorielFoxeye_NPC=He'd like you to know that our doors are open to you if you'd care to visit us.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_13_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC=You can find me at Sunblaze Court.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_14_Pragmatic_Default=Interested in Badlands treasures, I suppose, like everyone else?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_15_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Well, if you ever come across old spellbooks or spell scrolls, we'd love to see them.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_16_JorielFoxeye_NPC=In return, we have the largest collection of spells and potion recipes you could ever hope to see.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_17_Nosy_Default=More than the Arcaneum?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_18_JorielFoxeye_NPC=They would disagree - but yes.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_19_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Now, if you were to prefer feeding the New Empire's wizards with more magical knowledge than the Principality…
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_20_JorielFoxeye_NPC=…that would be troubling to many on the Council.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_21_Lawful_Default=Neutrality means we don't treat you any differently than we treat them.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_22_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Of course. Neutrality is the rule.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_01_23_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Good day to you, deputies.
Narration/&Council02_4_1_TowerBoss_NPC=Ah - our crownbearer is up again!
Narration/&Council02_4_2_Speaker_NPC=Honorable Council Members! Please take your seats!
Narration/&Council02_4_3_Speaker_NPC=Lord Danantar has the floor.
Narration/&Council02_4_4_Danantar_NPC=Thank you.
Narration/&Council02_4_5_Danantar_NPC=I have confirmed that our deputy is indeed magically attuned to the Crown.
Narration/&Council02_4_6_Danantar_NPC=It is… an uncommonly powerful attunement, unlike anything I've seen.
Narration/&Council02_4_7_Danantar_NPC=I strongly recommend against forcing a separation.
Narration/&Council02_4_8_Speaker_NPC=Chancellor Gormsdottir?
Narration/&Council02_4_9_AntiquarianBoss_NPC=With the Council's permission, I'd like to try a little experiment.
Narration/&Council02_4_10_AntiquarianBoss_NPC=I have here the gem that Captain Merran recovered recently.
Narration/&Council02_4_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC=I have reason to believe that it might be…
Narration/&Council02_4_12_AntiquarianBoss_NPC=As I suspected! It belongs to the Crown!
Narration/&Council02_4_13_Arcaneum_NPC=What have you done?
Narration/&Council02_4_14_EinarBoss_NPC=Commander! Take Her Royal Highness to safety!
Narration/&Council02_4_15_Princess_NPC=Wait!
Narration/&Council02_5_1_Arcaneum_NPC=Are you going to faint again?
Narration/&Council02_5_2_Crownbearer_WRITTEN=I just had a… vision, I guess it was.
Narration/&Council02_5_3_Crownbearer_WRITTEN=It's nothing.
Narration/&Council02_5_4_Crownbearer_WRITTEN=I must… find the other gems.
Narration/&Council02_5_5_Crownbearer_Answer=I just had a vision.
Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Answer=It's nothing.
Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Answer=The Crown wants the other gems back.
Narration/&Council02_5_5_Danantar_NPC=A vision? In an instant?
Narration/&Council02_5_6_Crownbearer_Default=I was fighting Soraks - but I wasn't myself.
Narration/&Council02_5_7_Crownbearer_Default=Then… who were you?
Narration/&Council02_5_8_Crownbearer_Default=A paladin… powerful…
Narration/&Council02_5_9_Crownbearer_Default=…from Tirmar.
Narration/&Council02_5_10_Danantar_NPC=That is… unsettling.
Narration/&Council02_5_11_AntiquarianBoss_NPC=Honorable delegates, I suggest we focus on the Soraks for now.
Narration/&Council02_5_12_Danantar_NPC=I concur.
Narration/&Council02_5_13_EinarBoss_NPC=What about this artifact? The other gems?
Narration/&Council02_5_14_TowerBoss_NPC=What?
Narration/&Council02_5_15_Crownbearer_Default=I think I can find them. I can… feel them.
Narration/&Council02_5_16_EinarBoss_NPC=You said it wasn't sentient.
Narration/&Council02_5_17_Danantar_NPC=This is old Manacalon magic. Anything is possible.
Narration/&Council02_5_18_Danantar_NPC=Let the crownbearer and the other deputies follow that quest.
Narration/&Council02_5_19_Danantar_NPC=Find the other gems if you can, but keep us informed.
Narration/&Council02_5_20_Danantar_NPC=In the meantime, we will formulate a response to the Soraks.
Narration/&Council02_5_21_AntiquarianBoss_NPC=Let's vote. Delegates - do you agree?
Narration/&Council02_5_22_All_NPC=Aye!
Narration/&Council02_5_23_Speaker_NPC=Your Royal Highness?
Narration/&Council02_5_24_Princess_NPC=Oh? pardon me. Yes, I concur…
Narration/&Council02_5_25_Speaker_NPC=To which proposition, Your Highness?
Narration/&Council02_5_26_Princess_NPC=I mean, aye. They should go and find the diamonds - the gems.
Narration/&Council02_5_27_Speaker_NPC=So resolved! Let it be recorded!
Narration/&Council02_5_28_Speaker_NPC=Thank you, honored delegates. The Council is now in recess.
Narration/&Council02_5_29_Char1_Default=What was that?
Narration/&Council02_5_30_Char1_Default=You had a vision?
Narration/&Council02_5_31_Char2_Default=What do you mean the Crown wants its missing gems?
Narration/&Council02_5_32_Crownbearer_Default=I… I can't explain. I just feel it. Anyway, we have a new mission.
Narration/&Council02_5_33_Char3_Default=All right, then. So where are we going, crownbearer?
Narration/&Council02_5_34_Crownbearer_Default=I think… the Crown knows.
Narration/&Merton_01_1_Merton_NPC=Look who's here! The Sorak hunters themselves!
Narration/&Merton_01_2_Any_Default=It's Merton, right? Arwin Merton?
Narration/&Merton_01_3_Merton_NPC=Damn right!
Narration/&Merton_01_4_Any_Default=First Scavenger? Where does that come from?
Narration/&Merton_01_5_Merton_NPC=Long story, kid.
Narration/&Merton_01_6_Merton_NPC=Short version: When we started crossing the Marches to the Badlands, I was one of the first.
Narration/&Merton_01_7_Merton_NPC=Now, I'm just the ugliest one still standing.
Narration/&Merton_01_8_Any_Default=What should we know about the Badlands? Any advice?
Narration/&Merton_01_9_Merton_NPC=Bring a good cleric with good healing spells. You'll need them.
Narration/&Merton_01_10_Any_Default=You're a legend. Why do you seem so sour?
Narration/&Merton_01_11_Merton_NPC=Sour? It's this ale that's sour, that's all.
Narration/&Merton_01_12_Merton_NPC=The high and mighty Council, paying clueless kids like you to go and get killed in the Badlands.
Narration/&Merton_01_13_Merton_NPC=But they're not asking good old Arwin - nooo. Go figure.
Narration/&Merton_01_14_Merton_NPC=It's because I got them figured out.
Narration/&Merton_01_15_Any_Default=Figured out how?
Narration/&Merton_01_16_Merton_NPC=This Legacy Council is full of it.
Narration/&Merton_01_17_Merton_NPC=Acting all united and lovey-dovey while they plot to rob each other.
Narration/&Merton_01_18_Merton_NPC=Wouldn't surprise me if some of them were even Soraks in disguise. You know they can shapeshift.
Narration/&Merton_01_19_Any_Default=Uh - okay…
Narration/&Merton_01_20_Merton_NPC=Hey, I was right about them hiding in the Badlands, wasn't I?
Narration/&Council03_1_LeiraKean_NPC=Honorable members of the Council, please be seated!
Narration/&Council03_2_LeiraKean_NPC=The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council03_3_LeiraKean_NPC=Lord Keenmind has the floor.
Narration/&Council03_4_Keenmind_NPC=Honorable members of the Council, we at the Arcaneum…
Narration/&Council03_5_Keenmind_NPC=…have gathered crucial information about this Crown.
Narration/&Council03_6_Keenmind_NPC=This is indeed the Crown of the Magister, belonging to Kaseinax, Eternal Soul of the Eight Traditions…
Narration/&Council03_7_Keenmind_NPC=…ninth and last Magister of the Manacalon Arcaneum.
Narration/&Council03_8_Keenmind_NPC=At the time, there were eight masters of magic, one for each of the old schools.
Narration/&Council03_9_Keenmind_NPC=In time of need, each of the masters lent their gem to the Magister, the head of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Council03_10_Keenmind_NPC=Placed in the Crown, they granted additional powers…
Narration/&Council03_11_Keenmind_NPC=…that enabled the Magister to cast spells or perform rituals of incredible power.
Narration/&Council03_12_Keenmind_NPC=Such as the closing of the Rift from Tirmar.
Narration/&Council03_13_All_NPC=overlapping murmurs
Narration/&Council03_14_Keenmind_NPC=Indeed.
Narration/&Council03_15_Keenmind_NPC=Now… there is some debate about…
Narration/&Council03_16_Keenmind_NPC=…whether the Crown, with all its gems…
Narration/&Council03_17_Keenmind_NPC=…could possibly open another Rift…
Narration/&Council03_18_All_NPC=overlapping protestations
Narration/&Council03_19_Keenmind_NPC=…or even reopen the previous one.
Narration/&Council03_20_Towerboss_NPC=Nonsense! The Rift has been closed for a millennium!
Narration/&Council03_21_Danantar_NPC=Solasta paid a high enough price for that!
Narration/&Council03_22_Antiquariansboss_NPC=Have you been to the Badlands recently?
Narration/&Council03_23_LeiraKean_NPC=Order!
Narration/&Council03_24_LeiraKean_NPC=Marshal Sunblaze has the floor.
Narration/&Council03_25_Einarboss_NPC=For our part, now that the existence of Sorr-Akkath on Solasta has been confirmed…
Narration/&Council03_26_Einarboss_NPC=…we have gathered proof that they are operating everywhere in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&Council03_27_Einarboss_NPC=Including here, in the Principality of Masgarth.
Narration/&Council03_28_Towerboss_NPC=Impossible!
Narration/&Council03_29_Einarboss_NPC=The Soraks are looking for the Crown and its gems. That cannot be a coincidence.
Narration/&Council03_30_Antiquariansboss_NPC=A powerful artifact, certainly - but reopening the Rift?
Narration/&Council03_31_Antiquariansboss_NPC=It took all the gods of Tirmar to open it!
Narration/&Council03_32_Einarboss_NPC=No one knows for sure what the Crown can do.
Narration/&Council03_33_Keenmind_NPC=It's a theory.
Narration/&Council03_34_Keenmind_NPC=As you know, it protects itself from our divination spells…
Narration/&Council03_35_Keenmind_NPC=…that is one of its mysterious powers.
Narration/&Council03_36_Towerboss_NPC=Then why would the Soraks think they know better?
Narration/&Council03_37_Einarboss_NPC=Because they're Soraks!
Narration/&Council03_38_Einarboss_NPC=Their people, their culture - they must have been obsessing about this for a thousand years!
Narration/&Council03_39_Einarboss_NPC=While we spent that time fighting each other, they had to stick together and hide to survive.
Narration/&Council03_40_Towerboss_NPC=Fables and conjectures!
Narration/&Council03_41_Antiquariansboss_NPC=Perhaps.
Narration/&Council03_42_Einarboss_NPC=But can we take the risk?
Narration/&Council03_43_Danantar_NPC=The Crown must be secured!
Narration/&Council03_44_Antiquariansboss_NPC=The Crown belongs to those who found it. Those are the rules.
Narration/&Council03_45_Antiquariansboss_NPC=The quest for the gems should be completed.
Narration/&Council03_46_Antiquariansboss_NPC=Only this way can we learn more about the Crown and its powers.
Narration/&Council03_47_Towerboss_NPC=These deputies - well, they're not strong enough! No offense.
Narration/&Council03_48_Antiquariansboss_NPC=Tell that to the Crown. And they've done well enough so far, wouldn't you say?
Narration/&Council03_49_Towerboss_NPC=This is nonsense!
Narration/&Council03_50_Princess_NPC=Maybe the deputies would like to speak.
Narration/&Council03_51_Princess_NPC=After all, they are members of the Council now, aren't they?
Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal_WRITTEN=We'll continue the quest.
Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default_WRITTEN=Give us weapons.
Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default_WRITTEN=You should trust us more.
Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default_WRITTEN=The Crown is ours.
Narration/&Council03_52_Authority_Normal=We feel perfectly able to continue searching for the gems.
Narration/&Council03_53_Authority_Formal=With all due respect, we are confident that we can fulfill this quest ourselves.
Narration/&Council03_54_Authority_Slang=We got this. Really, it's under control.
Narration/&Council03_55_Greed_Default=You can give us the means to be stronger. Weapons, armor, maybe some spells?
Narration/&Council03_56_Greed_Formal=May we be so bold as to ask your for material support? Weapons, armor, or spells, for instance?
Narration/&Council03_57_Greed_Slang=We'd be stronger if you tossed a few things our way. You know - weapons, armor, spells - that sort of thing.
Narration/&Council03_58_Lawfulness_Default=You may trust that we are devoted to this quest. We are well aware of its importance.
Narration/&Council03_59_Lawfulness_Formal=We are fully devoted to the quest, and perfectly aware of its vital importance.
Narration/&Council03_60_Lawfulness_Slang=We get it - this is big. We won't let you down!
Narration/&Council03_61_Selfishness_Default=We didn't change our mind about the Crown - it's ours!
Narration/&Council03_62_Selfishness_Formal=We must reiterate that we have no intention of giving up the Crown.
Narration/&Council03_63_Selfishness_Slang=Let's be clear. The Crown is ours, and it stays ours.
Narration/&Council03_64_Danantar_NPC=Confidence? I like that.
Narration/&Council03_65_Towerboss_NPC=Preposterous!
Narration/&Council03_66_Antiquariansboss_NPC=Five more gems to find. Do you even have a lead?
Narration/&Council03_67_Authority_Default=Yes - the best lead possible. The Crown itself tells us where to go.
Narration/&Council03_68_Einarboss_Default=The Soraks will come after you - you know that?
Narration/&Council03_69_Einarboss_Default=But you have our complete support in this struggle.
Narration/&Council03_70_Friendliness_Formal=Our thanks, Marshal.
Narration/&Council03_71_Friendliness_Normal=Thanks.
Narration/&Council03_72_Antiquariansboss_NPC=Don't overestimate yourselves, deputies!
Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_NPC=That's right! We can't risk the Soraks overpowering them and taking the Crown!
Narration/&Council03_74_Danantar_NPC=Well, you're welcome to provide them with whatever weapons and armors you like, Marshal.
Narration/&Council03_75_Greed_Default=We're just trying to increase our chance of success.
Narration/&Council03_76_Towerboss_NPC=Of course you are.
Narration/&Council03_77_Keenmind_NPC=We might have a few spells that can increase your chance of… survival.
Narration/&Council03_78_Danantar_NPC=Trust is a hot topic, these days.
Narration/&Council03_73_Einarboss_trust_NPC=Nobody here questions your dedication. You've done a lot already.
Narration/&Council03_71_Einarboss_NPC=Yet, we should support you in your efforts.
Narration/&Council03_72_Keenmind_NPC=And we will.
Narration/&Council03_73_Antiquariansboss_NPC=You understand, though - it is your responsibility to keep the Crown out of the wrong hands?
Narration/&Council03_74_Selfishness_Default=The Crown chose us. I doubt it would do any good to anyone else.
Narration/&Council03_75_Keenmind_NPC=Oh, so you're experts in Manacalon sorcery now?
Narration/&Council03_76_Einarboss_NPC=I can only concur. You have a responsibility, and it's more important than ownership.
Narration/&Council03_77_LeiraKean_NPC=If that is all, may we conclude?
Narration/&Council03_78_Princess_NPC=I'd like to say a word, if that is appropriate.
Narration/&Council03_79_LeiraKean_NPC=Of course, Your Highness. We are listening.
Narration/&Council03_80_Princess_NPC=I think our brave deputies shouldn't be, you know, sleeping in a… city inn.
Narration/&Council03_81_Princess_NPC=We have a very comfortable residence near the Palace.
Narration/&Council03_82_Princess_NPC=They would be safer there, don't you think?
Narration/&Council03_83_Princess_NPC=That would be my - I mean, our - part in supporting the quest.
Narration/&Council03_84_LeiraKean_NPC=Ahem - Your Highness?
Narration/&Council03_85_LeiraKean_NPC=I must remind you that your decisions as head of state are not subject to Council approval.
Narration/&Council03_86_Princess_NPC=Oh! Right…
Narration/&Council03_87_LeiraKean_NPC=Might I suggest that you reiterate your offer outside these walls?
Narration/&Council03_88_Princess_NPC=Of course. I beg the Council's pardon.
Narration/&Council03_89_LeiraKean_NPC=Not at all, Your Highness.
Narration/&Council03_90_Danantar_NPC=Then I think that is all?
Narration/&Council03_91_LeiraKean_NPC=Thank you. The Legacy Council is now in recess.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_1_Captain_NPC=A word, please, deputies?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Default=Sure.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Formal=Of course.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_2_Any_Slang=What's up?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_3_Captain_NPC=Her Royal Highness asked me to reiterate her offer to accommodate you at the Palace Residence.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Default=What's that?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_4_Any_Formal=I'm not sure what that is.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_5_Captain_NPC=A house for plenipotentiaries, emissaries, and other guests of the Court.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Default=Sounds nice.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_6_Any_Formal=It's an honor!
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_7_Captain_NPC=You don't say?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_8_Any_Default=Where is this residence?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_9_Captain_NPC=In the Palace. Ask for Ravensworth, the royal butler. He'll show you.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_10_Captain_NPC=Oh, another thing…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_11_Any_Default=Yes?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_12_Captain_NPC=I am to give this to any senior deputy of the Council.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_13_Any_Default=What's this?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_14_Captain_NPC=A command word, to teleport your party to the city's Imperial Gate.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_15__Any_Default=Teleport?
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_16_Any_Default=We can't do that, I'm pretty sure.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_17_Captain_NPC=Well, word is that in the Badlands…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_18_Captain_NPC=…you may come across functioning Major Gates.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_19_Captain_NPC=If you do, use this command word and you'll be brought back here.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_20_Captain_NPC=Take note of any command word on the Gate you find…
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_21_Captain_NPC=…and you'll be able to return there the same way.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_22_Any_Default=That's fantastic!
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_23_Captain_NPC=Don't get too excited.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_24_Captain_NPC=So far, no one's found any.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_25_Any_Default=Oh. Right. Thanks anyway.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_26_Captain_NPC=Stay in the light, senior deputies.
Narration/&HostOfPrincess_27_Any_Default=You too, Captain.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_1_DalonLark_NPC=Clear skies, adventurers!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_2_EinarWorshipper_Default=Fire to your blade!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_3_DalonLark_NPC=One of the faithful, I see. Nice to meet you!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_4_DalonLark_NPC=I am Chaplain Dalon Lark.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_5_DalonLark_NPC=You may come here at any time to seek the help of the Church.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_6_AnyBeliever_Einar=That is good to know, Chaplain!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_7_NonBeliever_Default=Hello!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_8_AnyBeliever_Default=What do you do here?
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_9_DalonLark_NPC=I represent the Church of Einar, the god of valor and fidelity.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_10_DalonLark_NPC=We provide various services for those who need them.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_11_Cynical_Default=And can pay for them?
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_12_DalonLark_NPC=Those who seek his healing are rarely poor.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_13_Any_Default=We do require your services.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_14_Any_Default=Thank you - we need to go.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_15_DalonLark_NPC=Stay in the light, adventurers!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ExitLine=We should go.
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_WRITTEN_ShopLine=We need your services.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Clear skies, adventurers!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_2_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Anything new for the Arcaneum?
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang=Check this out!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default=Possibly.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang=Just passing by.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=That's nice of you.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_02_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Exitline=Just passing by.
Narration/&Arcaneum_Dialog_Offer=Let's talk business!
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_1_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Deputies.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_2_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Do you have anything for the Circle?
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_3_Any_Default=Take a look.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_4_Any_Formal=We might.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_5_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Not really. Just stopped by to say hello.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_6_Any_Default=It's an honor.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_02_7_JorielFoxeye_NPC=Stay in the light, deputies!
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Exitline=Just saying hello.
Narration/&Danantar_Dialog_Offer=What about this?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_1_HalmanSummer_NPC=Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_2_HalmanSummer_NPC=You have some treasure in your backpacks?
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang=Feast your eyes on this!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default=See what you think of this.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_5_HalmanSummer_NPC=Just passing by to say hello.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_6_HalmanSummer_NPC=Ah, well. It was good to see you.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_02_7_HalmanSummer_NPC=See you next time, friends!
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_ExitLine=Just passing by.
Narration/&Antiquarians_Dialog_Offer=What about this?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_1_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=Deputies! How are you today?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_2_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=Do you have some lovely loot from the Badlands?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_3_Any_Slang=How 'bout that?
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_4_Any_Default=Indeed.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_5_Any_Slang=Just missed your smiling face, Miss Greenisle!
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_6_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=Such nice manners! All too rare, these days.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_02_7_MaddyGreenisle_NPC=Clear skies to you!
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Exitline=Just missed you.
Narration/&Tower_Dialog_Offer=How about that?
Narration/&Council4_1_LeiraKean_NPC=Honorable delegates, please be seated!
Narration/&Council4_2_LeiraKean_NPC=The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council4_3_Danantar_NPC=Ah - senior deputies! What news is there?
Narration/&Council4_4_Authority_Normal=We're stuck, my lord.
Narration/&Council4_5_Authority_Formal=My lord, I'm afraid the situation is less than ideal.
Narration/&Council4_6_Authority_Slang=It's not good news, my Lord.
Narration/&Council4_7_Faisech_NPC=Meaning what, exactly?
Narration/&Unused1=
Narration/&Unused2=
Narration/&Council4_10_Faisech_NPC=Perhaps they've been destroyed.
Narration/&Council4_11_Keenmind_NPC=We tested the first one - it can't be done!
Narration/&Council4_12_Danantar_NPC=They must be magically concealed.
Narration/&Council4_13_Sunblaze_NPC=So the Crown must remain incomplete?
Narration/&Council4_14_Gormsdottir_NPC=Maybe the Soraks have the missing gems.
Narration/&Council4_15_Gormsdottir_NPC=After all, they attacked you more than once. They're clearly still after the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_16_Faisech_NPC=If you can't find the gems, why keep the Crown out there?
Narration/&Council4_17_Faisech_NPC=It will keep attracting the Soraks.
Narration/&Council4_18_Danantar_NPC=The attunement, remember?
Narration/&Council4_19_Faisech_NPC=I'm sorry, senior deputies, but despite the attunement…
Narration/&Council4_20_Faisech_NPC=…I believe the Crown should be secured…
Narration/&Council4_21_Faisech_NPC=…and secured by more than four adventurers who spend their nights camped in the Badlands!
Narration/&Council4_22_Sunblaze_NPC=We can't do that to them! They have served the Council faithfully!
Narration/&Council4_23_Faisech_NPC=Don't be naive! We are facing a major threat!
Narration/&Council4_24_Faisech_NPC=You understand the meaning of sacrifice, and so should they!
Narration/&Council4_25_Authority_Normal=We have searched the Badlands for these gems, at our own risk.
Narration/&Council4_26_Crownbearer_Normal=We trusted you to keep your word and leave us the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_27_Danantar_NPC=If I may, I think we need more time to consider the situation.
Narration/&Council4_28_Faisech_NPC=More time? How much time?
Narration/&Council4_29_Danantar_NPC=Maybe just… give it a night.
Narration/&Council4_30_Gormsdottir_NPC=I could use the day to consult with my people.
Narration/&Council4_31_Keenmind_NPC=So could I.
Narration/&Council4_32_Danantar_NPC=Fine, then! Anyone against?
Narration/&Council4_33_LeiraKean_NPC=Thank you, Lord Danantar.
Narration/&Council4_34_LeiraKean_NPC=The Legacy Council is now adjourned!
Narration/&Council4_35_Selfpres_Normal=I have a bad feeling about this.
Narration/&Council4_36_Crownbearer_Normal=I knew it! They'll take the Crown, and never mind what that does to me!
Narration/&Council4_37_Crownbearer_Slang=Typical! Sat there on their pretty chairs… doesn't matter if I die!
Narration/&Council4_38_Authority_Normal=This is wrong.
Narration/&Council4_39_Selfpres_Normal=We could run.
Narration/&Council4_40_Authority_Normal=What's the point? We know what's at stake.
Narration/&Council4_41_Crownbearer_Normal=They're right about one thing.
Narration/&Council4_42_Crownbearer_Normal=The Soraks will keep coming after us. After the Crown.
Narration/&Council4_43_Authority_Normal=We could retrace our steps - go back to where we found the gems. Perhaps there's a trail we overlooked.
Narration/&Council4_44_Crownbearer_Normal=There's nothing anymore - I can't feel another gem anywhere!
Narration/&Council4_45_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Excuse me, senior deputies.
Narration/&Council4_46_Highclass_Formal=Master Surespell.
Narration/&Council4_47_Any_Normal=Clear skies, Heddlon.
Narration/&Council4_48_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=I would advise you to avoid the Palace Residence tonight.
Narration/&Council4_49_Crownbearer_Normal=What? Why?
Narration/&Council4_50_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=I'm not at liberty to say… just trust me.
Narration/&Council4_51_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=You have your lodgings at the Gravekeep's Cask. You should spend the night there.
Narration/&Council4_52_Selfpres_Normal=What kind of advice is that?
Narration/&Council4_53_Selfpres_Formal=You must realize your suggestion is… unusual. Suspicious, even.
Narration/&Council4_54_Selfpres_Slang=Are you crazy? Or are you up to something?
Narration/&Council4_55_Nosy_Normal=Are you really working for the Arcaneum?
Narration/&Council4_56_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Why else would I be here?
Narration/&Council4_57_Mean_Normal=This elf is…
Narration/&Council4_58_Lawful_Normal=What do you think?
Narration/&Council4_59_Pragmatic_Normal=It sounds like a warning.
Narration/&Council4_60_Selfpres_Normal=Or a threat!
Narration/&Council4_61_Lawful_Normal=Can we trust him?
Narration/&Council4_62_Carver_Normal=Trust the New Empire?
Narration/&Council4_63_Greed_Normal=I have no idea what to do, but I'd like to sleep in a bed tonight.
Narration/&Council4_64_Cynical_Normal=I miss Karel's beer.
Narration/&Council4_65_Any4_Normal=And Merton's sweet talk.
Narration/&Council4_66_Cynical_Normal=I'd prefer the residence.
Narration/&Council4_67_Cynical_Normal=I like Captain Ironshell kissing me goodnight.
Narration/&Council4_68_Authority_Normal=Maybe in your dreams.
Narration/&NightAttack_1_Selfpres_Default=Soraks - here?
Narration/&NightAttack_2_Selfpres_Slang=Soraks! Right here in our damn room!
Narration/&NightAttack_3_Selfpres_Formal=The Sorr-Akkath in the palace residence!
Narration/&NightAttack_4_Pragmatic_Default=We were warned.
Narration/&NightAttack_5_Nosy_Default=Surespell? How did he know?
Narration/&NightAttack_6_Nosy_Default=Why would he know what the Soraks would do?
Narration/&NightAttack_7_Pragmatic_Default=He tried to warn us. Not what an enemy would do.
Narration/&NightAttack_8_Pragmatic_Slang=He tried to save our hides, remember?
Narration/&NightAttack_9_Pragmatic_Formal=His warning might have saved us all, mind you.
Narration/&NightAttack_10_Selfpres_Normal=He just wants us to think he's a friend.
Narration/&NightAttack_11_Selfpres_Formal=It might be an elaborate scheme to gain our trust.
Narration/&NightAttack_12_Pragmatic_Default=Too far-fetched.
Narration/&NightAttack_13_Friendly_Default=So what do we do?
Narration/&NightAttack_14_Friendly_Slang=What's the plan, then?
Narration/&NightAttack_15_Friendly_Formal=Be that as it may, what shall we do now?
Narration/&NightAttack_16_Pragmatic_Normal=Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided.
Narration/&NightAttack_17_Pragmatic_Formal=We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say.
Narration/&NightAttack_18_Nosy_Default=Or we could pay Surespell a visit.
Narration/&NightAttack2_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Ah, here you are.
Narration/&NightAttack2_2_Any_Normal=Are you surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack2_3_Any_Formal=Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?
Narration/&NightAttack2_4_Any_Slang=That's right. Surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack2_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Not really. I did warn you, after all. I'm glad you were careful.
Narration/&NightAttack2_6_Any_Default=How did you know?
Narration/&NightAttack2_7_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Call it a hunch.
Narration/&NightAttack2_8_Any_Slang=A great, steaming pile of hunch. Got a bridge to sell, too?
Narration/&NightAttack2_9_Any_Normal=Oh, really?
Narration/&NightAttack2_10_Any_Formal=You can't expect us to believe that?
Narration/&NightAttack2_11_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Oh, I have friends who… gather information.
Narration/&NightAttack2_12_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=The threat felt credible. I thought it wise to share.
Narration/&NightAttack2_13_Cynical_Normal=It felt real enough to us, too.
Narration/&NightAttack2_14_Cynical_Formal=Real enough to leave a scar, that much is certain.
Narration/&NightAttack2_15_Selfpres_Default=You know more than you're telling.
Narration/&NightAttack2_16_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Always. But I'm on your side, and that's all that matters.
Narration/&NightAttack2_17_Cynical_Normal=Really? Aren't we lucky? So what other pearls of wisdom do you have to share - friend?
Narration/&NightAttack2_18_Cynical_Formal=In that case, you'd be happy to advise us further, I presume?
Narration/&NightAttack2_19_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Certainly. Always drink wine at the Gravekeep's Cask. Their beer is utterly foul.
Narration/&NightAttack2_20_Pragmatic_Normal=Seriously? Everyone knows that!
Narration/&NightAttack2_21_Pragmatic_Formal=That's disappointing. You can do better than common knowledge, I'm sure.
Narration/&NightAttack2_21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=But clearly you're here for business, not small talk.
Narration/&NightAttack4_1_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Ah, here you are.
Narration/&NightAttack4_2_Any_Normal=Are you surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack4_3_Any_Formal=Do you find our visit surprising, Master Surespell?
Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Slang=That's right. Surprised?
Narration/&NightAttack4_3_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Not at all, since you followed my… advice.
Narration/&NightAttack4_4_Any_Default=How do you know that?
Narration/&NightAttack4_5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=You're here, alive and unwounded.
Narration/&NightAttack4_6_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=I heard there was some disturbance at the residence.
Narration/&NightAttack4_7_Any_Default=Is that so?
Narration/&NightAttack3_1_CaptainIronshell_NPC=Senior deputies!
Narration/&NightAttack3_2_Friendly_Default=Captain! What's the news?
Narration/&NightAttack3_3_CaptainIronshell_NPC=You didn't hear?
Narration/&NightAttack3_4_CaptainIronshell_NPC=Your quarters at the residence were ransacked!
Narration/&NightAttack3_5_Nosy_Default=What? When?
Narration/&NightAttack3_6_CaptainIronshell_NPC=During the night. It's lucky you weren't there.
Narration/&NightAttack3_7_Cynical_Formal=Eh. We could have handled a burglar or two.
Narration/&NightAttack3_8_Cynical_Normal=No doubt we would have seen the villains off, had we been there.
Narration/&NightAttack3_9_CaptainIronshell_NPC=They were more than simple burglars, to infiltrate the palace undetected.
Narration/&NightAttack3_10_Nosy_Default=Who, then?
Narration/&NightAttack3_11_CaptainIronshell_NPC=I can't say for sure but…
Narration/&NightAttack3_12_CaptainIronshell_NPC=Some are saying… Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&NightAttack3_13_Selfpres_Formal=That's a worrying prospect, Captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_14_Selfpres_Slang=So much for palace security, then. Thanks a lot!
Narration/&NightAttack3_15_Selfpres_Normal=We were supposed to be safe there, remember?
Narration/&NightAttack3_16_CaptainIronshell_NPC=I'm well aware. We have put further magical security measures in place.
Narration/&NightAttack3_17_Friendly_Default=Good to know.
Narration/&NightAttack3_18_Friendly_Normal=Thanks for the heads-up, Captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_19_Friendly_Formal=Thank you for keeping us informed, Captain.
Narration/&NightAttack3_20_CaptainIronshell_NPC=You are most welcome.
Narration/&NightAttack3_21_CaptainIronshell_NPC=Good day to you, senior deputies.
Narration/&NightAttack3_22_Nosy_Normal=So he told the truth, that Heddlon.
Narration/&NightAttack3_23_Nosy_Formal=It appears Heddlon Surespell was right.
Narration/&NightAttack3_24_Pragmatic_Default=He knew, but how?
Narration/&NightAttack3_25_Selfpres_Normal=He's a spy, or something similar.
Narration/&NightAttack3_26_Selfpres_Formal=I'm pretty sure he's Imperial Intelligence.
Narration/&NightAttack3_27_Selfpres_Slang=The guy is a spook, it's practically written on his face.
Narration/&NightAttack3_28_Pragmatic_Default=He looks normal to me.
Narration/&NightAttack3_29_Logical_Default=That's what spies do.
Narration/&NightAttack3_30_Friendly_Default=So, what do we do?
Narration/&NightAttack3_31_Friendly_Slang=So - now what?
Narration/&NightAttack3_32_Friendly_Formal=We must decide on our next move.
Narration/&NightAttack3_33_Pragmatic_Normal=Back to the Council, I suppose, and see what they decided.
Narration/&NightAttack3_34_Pragmatic_Formal=We will return to the Council and hear what they have to say.
Narration/&NightAttack3_35_Nosy_Default=Or we could pay Surespell a visit.
Narration/&Council5_1_LeiraKean_NPC=Honorable delegates, please be seated!
Narration/&Council5_2_LeiraKean_NPC=The Legacy Council is now in session!
Narration/&Council5_3_LeiraKean_NPC=Chancellor Gormsdottir has the floor.
Narration/&Council5_4_Gormsdottir_NPC=Thank you, Protector.
Narration/&Council5_5_Gormsdottir_NPC=Honorable Council members, we at the Guild of Antiquarians have come to an agreement…
Narration/&Council5_6_Gormsdottir_NPC=…regarding the quest for the gems of the Crown of the Magister.
Narration/&Council5_7_Gormsdottir_NPC=We believe that the Crown should be secured, and therefore surrendered by its current owners…
Narration/&Council5_8_Gormsdottir_NPC=…in exchange for a generous payment…
Narration/&Council5_9_Gormsdottir_NPC=…raised by all parties in the Council.
Narration/&Council5_10_Crownbearer_Default=You can't!
Narration/&Council5_11_LeiraKean_NPC=You will wait for your turn to speak, senior deputy!
Narration/&Council5_12_Crownbearer_Default=We searched the Badlands for these gems, and now you're just taking the Crown away from us?
Narration/&Council5_13_LeiraKean_NPC=Order!
Narration/&Council5_14_Danantar_NPC=We are all well aware of your reservations, and we understand them.
Narration/&Council5_15_Danantar_NPC=Yet, from what I heard, all parties have agreed that you should comply…
Narration/&Council5_16_Danantar_NPC=…for the security of all.
Narration/&Council5_17_Crownbearer_Default=Security? You talk of security?
Narration/&Council5_18_Crownbearer_Default=What security? Just last night, Soraks attacked our quarters in the residence!
Narration/&Council5_19_Faisech_NPC=What?
Narration/&Council5_20_Sunblaze_NPC=Soraks? Here in Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&Council5_21_Danantar_NPC=In the palace?
Narration/&Council5_22_LeiraKean_NPC=Order!
Narration/&Council5_23_Sunblaze_NPC=Immediate action is needed!
Narration/&Council5_24_Danantar_NPC=Well, find the damned Soraks, then!
Narration/&Council5_25_LeiraKean_NPC=Please, my lords!
Narration/&Council5_26_Danantar_NPC=Where are your paladins?
Narration/&Council5_27_Sunblaze_NPC=Where are your wizards and their divination spells?
Narration/&Council5_28_LeiraKean_NPC=Stop it!
Narration/&Council5_29_LeiraKean_NPC=None of this is helping!
Narration/&Council5_30_LeiraKean_NPC=Lord Sunblaze, you're supposed to be neutral here!
Narration/&Council5_31_LeiraKean_NPC=Someone must introduce a formal request.
Narration/&Council5_32_Danantar_NPC=Right. Apologies.
Narration/&Council5_33_Danantar_NPC=You're right, let's vote. Only senior members, please.
Narration/&Council5_34_Danantar_NPC=Those for securing the Crown, say aye.
Narration/&Council5_35_Gormsdottir_Default=Aye.
Narration/&Council5_36_Faisech_NPC=Aye.
Narration/&Council5_37_Danantar_NPC=Aye.
Narration/&Council5_38_Keenmind_Default=…nay.
Narration/&Council5_39_Sunblaze_NPC=Nay.
Narration/&Council5_40_Danantar_NPC=Well, we have a majority.
Narration/&Council5_41_Sunblaze_NPC=We'll help you with the… attunement issue.
Narration/&Council5_42_Faisech_NPC=Wait! Who's going to take the Crown, and where?
Narration/&Council5_43_Danantar_NPC=Well, the most secure location would be…
Narration/&Council5_44_Danantar_NPC=…the temple of Einar, of course. The Hearth.
Narration/&Council5_45_Faisech_NPC=Of course - right here in Caer Cyflen!
Narration/&Council5_46_Faisech_NPC=Neutral ground, of course, but still the Principality of Masgarth is the center of Solasta!
Narration/&Council5_47_Danantar_NPC=Do you have a better idea, Dean Faisech?
Narration/&Council5_48_Faisech_NPC=We have secure locations, too!
Narration/&Council5_49_Danantar_NPC=How many high-ranking paladins in your Tower, Faisech?
Narration/&Council5_50_Faisech_NPC=More than actual wizards in your school!
Narration/&Council5_51_LeiraKean_NPC=Order!
Narration/&Council5_52_LeiraKean_NPC=Remember the dignity of your positions, my lords!
Narration/&Council5_53_LeiraKean_NPC=Senior deputies - if you please? The Council has spoken.
Narration/&Council5_54_Choice_Pragmatic_WRITTEN=This is a mistake.
Narration/&Council5_55_Choice_Mean_WRITTEN=You're all stupid!
Narration/&Council5_56_Choice_Lawful_WRITTEN=We must obey the Council…
Narration/&Council5_57_Choice_Selfpres_WRITTEN=Someone here is a traitor!
Narration/&Council5_58_Choice_Pragmatic_Default=This is a mistake. We are bound to the Crown.
Narration/&Council5_59_LeiraKean_NPC=You are sworn deputies. You must comply.
Narration/&Council5_60_Choice_Mean_Default=The Council doesn't deserve the Crown - you just proved that!
Narration/&Council5_61_LeiraKean_NPC=Surrender the Crown, as the Council orders.
Narration/&Council5_62_Choice_Lawful_Default=We serve the Council.
Narration/&Council5_63_LeiraKean_NPC=And you shall be commended, senior deputies.
Narration/&Council5_64_Choice_Selfpres_Default=You keep bickering instead of looking for the traitor among you!
Narration/&Council5_65_LeiraKean_NPC=This is a grave accusation, senior deputy.
Narration/&Council5_66_Authority_Default=How could they?
Narration/&Council5_67_Pragmatic_Default=It can't end like this!
Narration/&Council5_68_Crownbearer_Default=I can hear it calling!
Narration/&Council5_69_HalmanSummer_NPC=Senior deputies, please, a word?
Narration/&Council5_70_Authority_Default=Summer? What do you want?
Narration/&Council5_71_Authority_Default=Your chancellor led the charge against us in there.
Narration/&Council5_72_HalmanSummer_NPC=I'm truly sorry. But, I have some information that might interest you.
Narration/&Council5_73_Selfpres_Default=I doubt it.
Narration/&Council5_74_HalmanSummer_NPC=It's about the secret cult of Arivad.
Narration/&Council5_75_Nosy_Default=What?
Narration/&Council5_76_HalmanSummer_NPC=I admit, this is second-hand intelligence, but still…
Narration/&Council5_77_Authority_Default=Speak up.
Narration/&Council5_78_HalmanSummer_NPC=One of my people saw a man with a tattoo…
Narration/&Council5_79_Selfpres_Default=The letter A?
Narration/&Council5_80_HalmanSummer_NPC=Yes. He followed the man all day, and to a gathering that night…
Narration/&Council5_81_HalmanSummer_NPC=…in a remote village to the south.
Narration/&Council5_82_Authority_Default=What village?
Narration/&Council5_83_HalmanSummer_NPC=It's called Earcorn. Very small…
Narration/&Council5_84_HalmanSummer_NPC=…but you'll find it easily on any local map.
Narration/&Council5_85_Friendly_Default=Thank you, Halman.
Narration/&Council5_86_HalmanSummer_NPC=You're welcome. Someone must take care of these cultists.
Narration/&Council5_87_HalmanSummer_NPC=And the Council… well, you know.
Narration/&Council5_88_Pragmatic_Default=Yes, we do.
Narration/&Council5_After_1_BericSunblaze_NPC=I'm so sorry.
Narration/&Council5_After_2_Friendly_Default=Why? You didn't betray us.
Narration/&Council5_After_3_BericSunblaze_NPC=I understand how they see things, but…
Narration/&Council5_After_4_Selfpres_Normal=Something's wrong with the Council.
Narration/&Council5_After_5_Selfpres_Slang=The Council's rotten.
Narration/&Council5_After_6_BericSunblaze_NPC=The Council's still young. Everyone is angling for influence…
Narration/&Council5_After_7_BericSunblaze_NPC=…but squabbling academics are better than clashing armies.
Narration/&Council5_After_8_Nosy_Default=Only Airgetine supported us? I mean, beside you.
Narration/&Council5_After_9_Selfpres_Default=Why would the New Empire be the only friend we have in there?
Narration/&Council5_After_10_BericSunblaze_NPC=Airgetine's a moderate, it's true, but the New Empire is subtle. Plans within plans.
Narration/&Council5_After_11_BericSunblaze_NPC=It's hard to say whether he was following orders or voting his conscience.
Narration/&Council5_After_12_BericSunblaze_NPC=I wouldn't read too much into his vote, at least for now.
Narration/&Council5_After_13_BericSunblaze_NPC=It didn't change anything, anyway.
Narration/&Council5_After_14_BericSunblaze_NPC=But what about you? How are you coping without the Crown?
Narration/&Council5_After_15_Crownbearer_Default=Better than I expected.
Narration/&Council5_After_16_Any2_Default=Same for me, actually. It almost feels like we still have the Crown.
Narration/&Council5_After_17_Any3_Default=Exactly. We lost its magical power, but…
Narration/&Council5_After_18_Any2_Default=…the voice is still calling.
Narration/&Council5_After_19_BericSunblaze_NPC=Interesting. So the attunement is unaffected by physical separation?
Narration/&Council5_After_20_Friendly_Any=Keep the Crown safe, Marshal, will you, please?
Narration/&Council5_After_21_BericSunblaze_NPC=You have my word.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_1_Merton_NPC=Hey, you!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_2_Cynical_Default=Not drowning in your beer today, Arwin?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_3_Merton_NPC=No, wait!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_4_Merton_NPC=They took the Crown from you?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_5_Selfpres_Default=How do you know that?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_6_Merton_NPC=How? You really think I'm just a drunk?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_7_Merton_NPC=The whole Principality knows you have that Crown.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_8_Merton_NPC=I mean had.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_9_Cynical_Normal=Yeah.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_10_Cynical_Formal=Indeed.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_11_Merton_NPC=Something's not right.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_12_Cynical_Normal=You think we need you to tell us?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_13_Merton_NPC=I mean something's up - something big.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_14_Pragmatic_Normal=What, exactly?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_15_Merton_NPC=They're here.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_16_Selfpres_Default=Who? The Soraks?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_17_Merton_NPC=Not them. Their pawns.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_18_Lawful_Default=You're drunk.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_19_Merton_NPC=What's wrong with you?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_20_Merton_NPC=Haven't you seen enough?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_21_Merton_NPC=Didn't you see what they can do?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_22_Merton_NPC=To people?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_23_Merton_NPC=At first I thought you were just another bunch of brainless Council lackeys…
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_24_Merton_NPC=…but you've seen their ways.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_25_Merton_NPC=At Coparann, and plenty other places, I'm sure.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_26_Merton_NPC=The way they get into people's heads.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_27_Merton_NPC=I've watched the people of Caer Cyflen for ten years.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_28_Merton_NPC=I've felt a change - slow, subtle…
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_29_Merton_NPC=…until now. It's getting stronger!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_30_Merton_NPC=I can't let them win.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_31_Cynical_Default=So what? You're ready to become a hero again?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_32_Merton_NPC=I can still fight.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_33_Pragmatic_Default=Are you offering to join us?
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_34_Merton_NPC=You brought back my sword.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_35_Merton_NPC=That blade and I, we've slain countless abominations down there in the Badlands.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_36_Merton_NPC=You helped me get closure for my lost child.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_37_Merton_NPC=You were at my side when we took down the remorhaz.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_38_Merton_NPC=Yes, I'd like to join you.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_39_Choice_WRITTEN=Fine.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_40_Choice_WRITTEN=No.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_41_Agreed_Default=Fine, come with us.
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_42_Refused_Default=You're useless!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_43_Refused_Merton=And you're stupid!
Narration/&MertonAfterCouncil5_44_Agreed_Merton=Ha ha! Now you're talking!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_1_Authority_Default=This is it? Earcorn!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_2_Merton_NPC=Look, a farm! And another! High adventure - I love it!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_3_Cynical_Normal=This doesn't exactly feel like the headquarters for a massive invasion.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_4_Cynical_Slang=Some headquarters. Dark cults used to be better.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_5_Cynical_Formal=Not exactly how I imagined the lair of evil Sorr-Akkath worshippers.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_6_Pragmatic_Default=But it could be hiding a small group of infiltrators.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_7_Pragmatic_Default=Still, a good cover for cunning infiltrators.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_8_Pragmatic_Normal=Let's look around for anything suspicious.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_9_Pragmatic_Formal=Let us examine the area in search of clues.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_10_Cynical_Default=No tavern? That's suspicious for a start.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_11_Merton_NPC=That was my line!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_12_Authority_Slang=Shut up! We're trying to be stealthy!
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_13_Authority_Normal=You'd better be quiet if you don't want us to be spotted.
Narration/&FightingCultists_1_14_Authority_Format=Quiet, if you please. Let discretion be our watchword.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_1_Any_Default=I have something!
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_2_Cynical_Default=Footprints? Really? It's a village. People live here.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_3_Cynical_Default=Random footprints in a village? Not much of a clue.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_4_Merton_NPC=Your villagers have claws.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_5_Any_Default=Your villagers have claws.
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_6_Selfpres_Default=Soraks?
Narration/&FightingCultists_2_7_Authority_Default=This is it! Be ready for anything.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_1_Pragmatic_Default=That didn't feel like we surprised them.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_2_Violent_Default=Because we didn't.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_3_Selfpres_Default=This was a trap.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_4_Merton_NPC=Yep, carefully set up to kill us - well, you, I guess.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_5_Selfpres_Default=Halman Summer?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_6_Pragmatic_Default=He said the intelligence wasn't certain.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_7_Merton_NPC=The Antiquarian? He told you about this place?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_8_Violent_Default=He's a traitor!
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_9_Nosy_Default=A Sorak in disguise?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_10_Pragmatic_Default=Or just one of their agents.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_11_Merton_NPC=Or just one of their agents.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_12_Pragmatic_Default=Anyone checked him for a tattoo?
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_13_Violent_Default=There's only one way to know for sure.
Narration/&AfterFightingCultists_14_Authority_Default=Let's go back to Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Normal=What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_1_Selfpres_Formal=What is all this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_2_Pragmatic_Default=Is that the army? In the city?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_3_Violent_Default=Let's find Summer!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_4_Pragmatic_Default=I'd prefer to find Carran first.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_5_Merton_NPC=I have to check on someone. I'll catch you later.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_6_Nosy_Default=Check on who?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_7_Nosy_Default=I thought he had no friends left.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_8_Cynical_Default=His brewer, maybe?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Normal=Hello, Karel! Have you seen Lord Carran?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Slang=Hey, Karel! Seen Carran around?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_1_Any_Formal=Greetings, master Martel. Have you seen lord Carran recently?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_2_KarelMartel_NPC=Not since the conscription.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_3_Any_Default=Conscription? Is that what's happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_4_KarelMartel_NPC=I know, it's been in the air, but now…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_5_KarelMartel_NPC=…rumors has it that Gallivan's armies are massing at the eastern border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_6_Any_Default=Gallivan? Why?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Bartender_7_KarelMartel_NPC=Ask your friends on the Council. They were supposed to keep the peace.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar1_Any_Default=Robar? You've been drafted?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar2_Robar_NPC=Don't be ridiculous - I enlisted! Gets me the rank I deserve. Finally.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar3_Any_Default=Captain? That's even higher than Beryl Stonebeard.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar4_Robar_NPC=I'd rather forget that time, fighting Soraks in that hellhole Caer Lem.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar5_Any_NPC=Is war really better?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar6_Sellsword_Default=Can't disagree.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar7_Robar_NPC=Gallivan's armies are honest foes - flesh, blood, and steel.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar8_Any_NPC=If you say so.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar9_Any_NPC=Be safe, Robar.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar10_Sellsword_Default=To the bitter end, brother.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar11_Robar_Default=To the bitter end.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Robar12_Robar_Default=You, too.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Any_NPC=Beryl? What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl1_Highclass_Default=Lady Stonebeard, what is happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl2_Beryl_NPC=You still here? I suppose we owe this mess to you?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl3_Any_Default=What mess?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl4_Beryl_NPC=War. Or the threat of war.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl5_Any_Default=We didn't do anything!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl6_Beryl_NPC=Well, the Snow Alliance representatives are leaving.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl7_Beryl_NPC=We don't want to be caught between Masgarth and Gallivan.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl8_Any_Default=How about maintaining peace?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl9_Beryl_NPC=I did my part. Didn't work.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl10_Any_Default=When are you leaving?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl11_Beryl_NPC=As soon as my dawdling cousin gives the order.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl12_Beryl_NPC=Let's hope we can meet again, on the same side.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl13_Any_NPC=Farewell, Beryl.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl14_Highclass_Default=Good luck, my lady.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Beryl15_Beryl_NPC=Cut the 'my' lady stuff, will you?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat1_Any_Default=Daliat! What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat2_Daliat_NPC=Well, I'd rather not say.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat3_Any_Default=Always secretive.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat4_Spy_Default=Do we still need to play this game?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat5_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Oh, hello.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat6_Any_Default=Heddlon Surespell, what a surprise.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat7_Spy_Default=Are you two related?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat8_Daliat_NPC=He's my superior.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat9_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Two ranks above.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat10_Daliat_Default=Right.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat11_Spy_NPC=So, you two are spies?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat12_HeddlonSurespell_Default=Such a crude word.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat13_Daliat_NPC=We prefer the old name: 'Silent Whisper.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat14_Lawful_Default=The intelligence service of the Manacalon Empire? Really?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat15_Daliat_NPC=Nicer than 'spies.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat16_Authority_Default=So, what's in there?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat17_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Nothing and no one, I'm afraid.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat18_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=I was looking for your… acquaintance, Halman Summer.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat19_Violent_Default=Oh, him?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat20_Violent_Default=We were looking for him, too.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat21_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=I'm afraid he's gone.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat22_Pragmatic_Default=Isn't everybody leaving?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat23_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=The Antiquarians and the other Snow Alliance people are pulling out.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat24_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=The Antiquarians are still packing up, though.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat25_Pragmatic_Default=He sent after a lead…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat26_Selfpres_Default=…or rather, into a trap.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat27_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=I'm not surprised.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat28_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=We had eyes on him, but… we lost him.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat29_Selfpres_Default=Is he that good?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat30_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Or he had help. Magical.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat31_Selfpres_NPC=Soraks?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat32_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=Who knows?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat33_Pragmatic_NPC=What triggered all this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat34_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=You should really get to the Council.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_HalmanDaliat35_HeddlonSurespell_NPC=They'll tell you everything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_1_Carran_NPC=In Maraike's name! You're here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_Any_Default=What is happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_3_Carran_NPC=The whole delegation from the Tower of Knowledge - they were poisoned!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_4_Nosy_Default=Poisoned? How many died?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_5_Carran_NPC=All of them, thirty-something, but that's not the point.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_6_Carran_NPC=After Dean Faisech accused the Council of… favoritism toward the Principality…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_7_Carran_NPC=…for keeping the Crown in Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_8_Pragmatic_Default=At the Temple of Einar, which is not affiliated with the Principality.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_9_Carran_NPC=I know that, of course.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_10_Carran_NPC=Yet, soon after, we all ate at the same table, but the Tower delegates died in their sleep.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_11_Carran_NPC=Of course, Gallivan took it as an attack by the Principality.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_12_Pragmatic_Default=But that's why the Tower's on the Council, and not Gallivan's government - to avoid exactly that!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_13_Carran_NPC=You think I don't know that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_14_Carran_NPC=This is real politics, my friends - diplomacy is dead.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_15_Cynical_Default=So the Legacy Council was a sham all along?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_16_Carran_NPC=No! It was a real, honest effort to maintain peace.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_17_Cynical_Default=And it failed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_18_Carran_NPC=We're not at war yet.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_19_Pragmatic_Default=But Gallivan's massing troops at the border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_20_Carran_NPC=Bad news really does travel fast.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_21_Carran_NPC=Anyway, pressure is growing for the Princess to… intervene.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_22_Cynical_Default=Her? How?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_23_Carran_NPC=Not as a member of the Council. As head of state.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_24_Carran_NPC=But tell me, where were you now that your quest is… well…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_25_Authority_Default=Chasing the Soraks and their pawns.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_26_Cynical_Default=Unsuccessfully.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_27_Violent_Default=Halman Summer might have been one of them.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_28_Carran_NPC=What? The man was… I mean, I dined at his mansion recently… he…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_29_Nosy_Default=Where?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_30_Carran_NPC=Where what?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_31_Authority_Default=A mansion? He told us he lived at the Snow Alliance embassy.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_32_Carran_NPC=No - his family has a mansion in town.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_33_Carran_NPC=Oddly, it's right next door to the Circle of Danantar's headquarters.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_34_Authority_Default=We need to go there.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_35_Carran_NPC=I might need you when you're done with this errand.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad1_Authority_Normal=Is that it?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad2_Authority_Formal=Is this the place?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad3_Nosy_Normal=I don't see a sign, or a coat of arms, or anything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad4_Nosy_Formal=Nothing to say this is Halman Summer's residence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad5_Spy_Normal=Not bad for a secret home.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad6_Spy_Slang=He's no dummy.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad7_Pragmatic_Formal=And close to official buildings - who would suspect anything?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad8_Pragmatic_Normal=Hiding in plain sight - classic.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad9_Spy_Default=Let's go around. Maybe find a window and get inside.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad10_Lawful_Default=We should obtain a warrant.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad11_Pragmatic_Default=We're past that, don't you think?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad12_Violent_Default=Since I intend to kill him, I believe we are.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivad13_Spy_Default=Come on - they're all preparing for war, no one's paying attention.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside1_Any_Normal=This place is… insane.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside2_Any_Formal=Truly, a den of madness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside3_Religion_Maraike_Default=Holy Maraike…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside4_Religion_Einar_Default=Einar protect us all…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside5_Religion_Arun_Default=In the name of Arun, this place is unthinkable!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside6_Religion_Pakri_Default=Pakri be with us, we have found our enemy!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside7_Lawful_Default=In the middle of Caer Cyflen! How could they…?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside8_Pragmatic_Default=Dissimulation is their creed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside9_Violent_Default=This ends now. Let's kill them all!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadInside10_Pragmatic_Default=Maybe they have the gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded1_Friendly_Normal=Hey - I've seen this man at the Gravekeep's Cask!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded_Friendly_Formal=I know that face! He was at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded2_Pragmatic_Normal=They're all from town!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded3_EinarAuthority_Normal=Corrupted by the Soraks!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded4_Selfpres_Normal=For years, maybe. They were preparing.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded5_Greed_Normal=There's a ton of paperwork here.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded6_Pragmatic_Normal=A lot's been burned, though.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded7_Greed_Normal=No sign of the gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded8_Pragmatic_Normal=Look at this - a map of the Badlands.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded9_Nosy_Normal=What are these places?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded10_Pragmatic_Normal=Everywhere we've been… and some other places.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded11_Greed_Normal=The gems… all eight of them.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded12_Nosy_Normal=And this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded13_History_Normal=Probably the location of the Rift.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded14_History_Normal=It's in the Aer Elai, the heart of Manacalon. Where the capital was.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded15_Nosy_Normal=And this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded16_Pragmatic_Normal=No idea.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded17_Carver_Normal=Not a dwarf rune.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded18_Greed_Normal=I have a list of names.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded19_Greed_Normal=Some are marked 'converted,' some 'resilient,' and some 'prospects.'
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded20_Pragmatic_Normal=There's a whole book of names here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded21_Lawful_Normal=We must take this to the authorities!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded22_Helpful_Normal=There will be civil war if we do. People will kill their neighbors!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_CovenOfArivadEnded23_Violent_Normal=War is coming whatever we do.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_1_Player_Normal=Carran!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_2_Player_Formal=Lord Carran!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_3_Carran_NPC=This isn't a good time.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_4_Player_Normal=We're aware - the city's full of Sorak pawns!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_5_Player_Formal=Indeed, and we have proof of an imminent Sorak attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_6_Carran_NPC=Surely you exaggerate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_7_Player_Normal=Here! A list of all those under or soon to be under Sorak influence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_8_Carran_NPC=What? Where did you find this?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_9_Player_Normal=Halman Summer's mansion. He was one of them!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_10_Carran_NPC=I can't believe it… all this time…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_11_Player_Normal=There's more!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_12_Player_Normal=Everything suggests that the Soraks have the missing gems.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_13_Player_Normal=They had a map showing everywhere we found gems, plus two other places.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_14_Carran_NPC=Maraike's mercy!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_15_Carran_NPC=We must convene the Council, but… this really isn't the best time.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_16_Player_Normal=The Gallivan situation, I suppose?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_17_Player_Slang=Gallivan, eh? How is it going?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_18_Carran_NPC=All the city's clerics are working to resurrect the victims. I hope it's enough.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_19_Greed_Default=More than thirty? That's a lot of diamonds. And clerics.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_20_Carran_NPC=We didn't really have a choice. The Crown is going to pay.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_21_Greed_Default=What?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_22_Carran_NPC=The envoy from Gallivan was… adamant.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_23_Carran_NPC=The Princess took command of the situation…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_24_Carran_NPC=…and told him Masgarth would pay to resurrect their people.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_25_Pragmatic_Default=So why the troops at the border?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_26_Carran_NPC=Let's call it… an incentive.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_27_Pragmatic_Default=Everything should be fine, then.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_28_Pragmatic_Default=The Principality resurrects the poison victims, Gallivan withdraws its troops.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_29_Carran_NPC=Let's hope so. We don't have any idea who's behind this.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_30_Carran_NPC=Though your little book of secrets here might help us with that.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_31_Violent_Default=So, the Principality is still drafting soldiers.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_32_Carran_NPC=To defend the city.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_33_Carran_NPC=The army left for the border as soon as we heard about the threat.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_34_Cynical_Default=So much for confidence.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_35_Carran_NPC=Smiles work better if you have a sword at your side.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_36_Greed_Default=So you're resurrecting Faisech?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_37_Greed_Default=How much is that? A thousand gold pieces?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_38_Carran_NPC=I know what you're going to say. So don't.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_39_Cynical_Default=And someone must pray for his soul… Imagine that!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_40_Carran_NPC=Marshal Sunblaze is taking care of the senior delegates personally.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_41_Selfpres_Default=Wait a minute!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_42_Selfpres_Default=Where is this happening?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_43_Carran_NPC=In the Temple of Einar. You've been in their dispensary…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_44_Carran_NPC=Wait, you don't… they died!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_45_Selfpres_Default=You think they'd stop at that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_46_Pragmatic_NPC=Thirty-something people inside the most secure place in the Principality…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_47_Pragmatic_NPC=More than thirty possible traitors in the most protected temple in the Principality…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_48_Violent_NPC=…close to the Crown of the Magister?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_49_Carran_NPC=No! No, no, no!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Carran_2_50_Authority_NPC=What are we waiting for?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_1_Authority_Default=Marshal!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_2_BericSunblaze_NPC=Greetings, friends!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_3_Authority_Default=Where are the delegates?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_4_BericSunblaze_NPC=In the dispensary.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_5_BericSunblaze_NPC=What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_6_Friendly_Default=Are you all right?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_7_BericSunblaze_NPC=I just cast a resurrection spell… forgive me - it is rather draining.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_8_BericSunblaze_NPC=Wait!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_9_Cynical_Normal=Feeling good, dead people?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_10_Cynical_Formal=All right, everyone, we know who you are.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple1_11_SorakAgent_NPC=Attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_1_BericSunblaze_NPC=By Einar… Sorak agents, in the temple!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_2_Authority_Default=Where's the Crown?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_3_BericSunblaze_NPC=Take this key. I… can't run.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_4_BericSunblaze_NPC=Follow the light!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple2_5_Authority_Default=Let's go!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_1_Authority_Default=There!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_2_Selfpres_Default=It's gone!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_3_Pragmatic_Default=Here! A secret passage?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_4_Selfpres_Default=In the middle of the temple?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_5_Authority_Default=How did they miss that?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_6_Pragmatic_Default=Doesn't matter now!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Pragmatic_Default=This is ancient - from the first centuries after the Cataclysm!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_8_Pragmatic_Default=No time for a history lesson!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple3_7_Any_Default=They went this way!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_1_Any_Default=The city's Imperial Gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_2_Any_Default=They're here!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_3_Any_Default=They're trying to get away with the Crown!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_4_Any_Default=Protector!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_5_LeiraKean_NPC=We failed! They got away with it!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_6_Any_Default=No!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_7_Merton_NPC=They must not destroy the gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_8_Any_Default=It's not over! They must not destroy the gate!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple4_9_Merton_NPC=There's too many of them!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple9_Merton_NPC=Come on! Fight!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_1_Any_Default=Look!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_2_Any_Default=The Princess?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_3_Merton_NPC=Ha, ha, ha! Come on, old lady - time to show off!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Temple5_4_Princess_NPC=One day, Arwin Merton…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter1_Princess_NPC=Don't look at me like that.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter2_Any_Default=Your Royal Highness…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter3_Princess_NPC=…thank you is what you're looking for.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter4_Any_Default=Thank you.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter5_Pragmatic_Default=They took the Crown.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter6_Princess_NPC=Is this… evil god coming?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter7_Authority_Default=I suppose that's their plan.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter8_Pragmatic_Default=Can we follow them?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter9_Selfpres_Default=There's no way to know where they've gone.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter10_Selfpres_Default=There are so many gates.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter11_Pragmatic_Default=Close to the Rift, right? Where it all began?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter12_Authority_Default=No one knows exactly where the Rift was.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter13_Merton_NPC=In the Aer Elai, near the capital of Manacalon - but it's a vast area!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter14_Pragmatic_Default=They must have scouted it and found a teleporter nearby.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter15_Selfpres_Default=So we're doomed?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter16_Authority_Default=What's going on?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter17_Merton_NPC=We're under attack!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter18_Merton_NPC=Sleeper agents! Everywhere in the city!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter19_Princess_Default=Are they so powerful, the Sorr-Akkath?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter20_History_Default=Your Royal Highness…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter21_History_Default=We found this in Halman Summer's chambers, magically concealed.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter22_History_Default=Do you have any ideas?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter23_Princess_NPC=This is Sunset Peak, south of Aer Elai.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter24_Princess_NPC=I recognize this tower… or what's left of it.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter25_Princess_NPC=There is a gate not too far away.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter26_Princess_NPC=But who knows how the place looks like now?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter27_Authority_Default=We're running out of time! If there is a chance to stop them…
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter28_Violent_Default=They don't stand a chance against you!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter29_Princess_NPC=Alas, I cannot go into the Badlands.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter30_Nosy_Default=What? Why?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter31_Princess_NPC=Long story short: it would kill me faster than any dark god.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter32_Princess_NPC=There's no time to explain - you have to trust me.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter33_Princess_NPC=Only you can save Solasta now.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter34_Selfpres_Default=Us? What about all your… heroes, and all?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter35_Princess_NPC=Marshal Sunblaze is weakened from casting Resurrection spells, and so are most of his clerics.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter36_Pragmatic_Default=Oh… they planned this as well, didn't they?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter37_Princess_NPC=All my best fighters and spellblades are on the border.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter38_Princess_NPC=Protector Kean is not what she used to be.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter39_Authority_Default=Merton? You coming?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter40_Princess_NPC=He's staying with me. Caer Cyflen is on fire, its streets full of Sorak pawns on a murder spree.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter41_Princess_NPC=The Crown needs you. I felt it, from the beginning.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter42_Princess_NPC=Kaseinax's spirit calls for you to save him from the darkness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter43_Nosy_Default=The Magister? You knew him?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter44_Princess_NPC=You're too curious for your own good.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter45_Authority_Default=So, Merton's staying.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter46_Merton_NPC=Can't say no to a princess. Especially that one.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter47_Authority_Default=Fine, then.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter48_Princess_NPC=I can only give you a few trinkets to help you in your endeavor.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter49_Princess_NPC=And my blessing.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter50_Sellsword_Default=My arm is yours, Princess.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter51_Aristocrat_Default=Serving you is the greatest honor, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter52_Spy_Default=You're definitely the best crowned head around.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter53_Academic_Default=To think that you knew the Magister? I have so many questions!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter54_Lowlife_Default=That's more than enough, Princess. We'll do your dirty work.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter55_Lawkeeper_Default=We will prevail or die, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter56_Philosopher_Default=So powerful - and yet so helpless to save Solasta. Fascinating.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter57_AcolyteEinar_Default=Einar will be with us, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter58_AcolyteMaraike_Default=Maraike will be with us in life and death.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter59_AcolyteArun_Default=May Arun guide us all.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter60_AcolytePakri_Default=Justice will be served, your royal highness.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter61_Princess_NPC=You should rest and prepare yourselves.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter62_Authority_Default=Sleep, now? There's no time!
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter63_Princess_NPC=You really should start admitting that you don't know everything.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter64_Princess_NPC=Rest now. Time will wait for you, I promise.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter65_Princess_NPC=I will speak the words that will activate the gate for Sunset Peak.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_Teleporter66_Princess_NPC=When you are ready, step onto the gate, and fulfill your destiny.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse1_Nosy_Default=Did she just… stop time?
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse2_Acolyte_Default=This is unnatural.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse3_Selfpres_Default=I won't be able to sleep now.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse4_Authority_Default=You know what's at stake.
Narration/&ReturnToCC_TimeLapse5_Authority_Default=We'll need to be ready for anything.
Narration/&Mertonswife1_Bitterroot_NPC=Damned Soraks right under our noses, eh?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_Bitterroot_NPC=It's worse than I thought. I met with this fake baron more than once recently…
Narration/&Mertonswife3_Bitterroot_NPC=Didn't see a difference.
Narration/&Mertonswife4_Lawful_Normal=Nice to meet you, too.
Narration/&Mertonswife5_Lawful_Formal=And who might you be, lady?
Narration/&Mertonswife6_Bitterroot_NPC=Call me Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife7_Nosy_Formal=That's a peculiar name.
Narration/&Mertonswife8_Nosy_Normal=So that's not your real name?
Narration/&Mertonswife9_Bitterroot_NPC=It's the only name I need.
Narration/&Mertonswife10_Bitterroot_NPC=Tell me something.
Narration/&Mertonswife11_Bitterroot_NPC=You're bound to the Legacy Council, right?
Narration/&Mertonswife12_Cynical_Normal=I knew these badges would help eventually.
Narration/&Mertonswife13_Friendly_Normal=Yes, we are. Interested in joining?
Narration/&Mertonswife14_Bitterroot_NPC=Ever heard of Arwin Merton? He's probably marinating in some tavern in Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&Mertonswife15_Authority_Normal=We met him.
Narration/&Mertonswife16_Bitterroot_NPC=If you'd be so kind, I have something I'd like you to take back to him.
Narration/&Mertonswife17_Bitterroot_NPC=A message, and a gift.
Narration/&Mertonswife18_Violent_Normal=Why not go yourself?
Narration/&Mertonswife19_Bitterroot_NPC=I'm not going to him. He needs to come to me.
Narration/&Mertonswife20_Helpful_Normal=A personal matter?
Narration/&Mertonswife21_Helpful_Slang=He cheated on you or something?
Narration/&Mertonswife22_Helpful_Formal=Sounds like a sensitive topic.
Narration/&Mertonswife23_Bitterroot_NPC=I'd rather not go into detail.
Narration/&Mertonswife24_Authority_Slang=What's the gift?
Narration/&Mertonswife25_Authority_Normal=What do we need to take back?
Narration/&Mertonswife26_Bitterroot_NPC=A longsword.
Narration/&Mertonswife27_Pragmatic_Normal=Not too heavy. We could do that.
Narration/&Mertonswife28_Greed_Normal=But what's the reward?
Narration/&Mertonswife29_Bitterroot_NPC=Ah - real heroes!
Narration/&Mertonswife30_Bitterroot_NPC=I can give you the location of a… treasure.
Narration/&Mertonswife31_Cynical_Normal=Of course, everyone keeps a treasure map in their pocket, just in case…
Narration/&Mertonswife32_Bitterroot_NPC=It's a Manacalon building in the Badlands.
Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC=The Arcaneum wanted me to loot it.
Narration/&Mertonswife33_Bitterroot_NPC2=Apparently, it was a Silent Whisper base before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Mertonswife34_Greed_Normal=Heddlon Surespell would pay a fortune for what's inside.
Narration/&Mertonswife35_Bitterroot_NPC=But it's full of monsters. Too many for me.
Narration/&Mertonswife36_Friendly_Normal=We could team up.
Narration/&Mertonswife37_Bitterroot_NPC=I've… lost the taste for adventuring.
Narration/&Mertonswife38_Bitterroot_NPC=Do we have a deal?
Narration/&Mertonswife39_Helpful_NPC=Sure.
Narration/&Mertonswife40_Selfpres_NPC=Not interested.
Narration/&Mertonswife41_Agree_NPC=Fine, what's the message?
Narration/&Mertonswife42_Choice_Refuse=Sorry. We have more important things to do.
Narration/&Mertonswife43_Choice_Accept=As you wish.
Narration/&Mertonswife44_Biterroot_NPC=Tell him he still owes me a child, and I'm waiting. Here, in Coparann.
Narration/&Mertonswife45_Any_Normal=All right… we'll tell him that.
Narration/&Mertonswife46_Any_Formal=Fine, we'll take your message to him.
Narration/&Mertonswife47_Biterroot_NPC=Thank you. Here's the blade. And the map.
Narration/&Mertonswife48_Friendly_Normal=Farewell, Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_1_Any_Normal=Hello, Arwin.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_2_Merton_NPC=Arwin? We're friends now?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_3_Merton_NPC=I'll keep calling you kid, I think.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_4_Any_Normal=Whatever.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_5_Any_Formal=Suit yourself.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_6_Any_Normal=We've been to Coparann - ring a bell?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_7_Any_Formal=I suppose you know the name Coparann.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_8_Merton_NPC=You bet.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_9_Any_Normal=Apparently, you are indebted to someone there.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_10_Any_Normal=An elf ranger. She calls herself Bitterroot.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_11_Merton_NPC=Really?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_12_Any_Normal=Something to do with her mood, maybe.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_13_Any_Normal=She said you owe her… a child.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_14_Merton_NPC=She's crazy.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_15_Any_Normal=We just said we'd bring the message. She's still waiting.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_16_Merton_NPC=Yeah… thanks for the message.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_17_Any_Normal=Want to tell us what this is about?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_18_Any_Formal=Maybe you would like to share a story with us?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_19_Merton_NPC=No. I don't.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_20_Any_Normal=You didn't take her child away from her?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_21_Merton_NPC=You're out of line. I'd step back if I were you.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_22_Any_Normal=All right. It's none of our business.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_23_Any_Normal=She gave us this for you.
Narration/&Mertonswife2_24_Merton_NPC=What?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_25_Merton_NPC=I don't believe it!
Narration/&Mertonswife2_26_Merton_NPC=She went back for it…
Narration/&Mertonswife2_27_Any_Normal=Feel more like talking now?
Narration/&Mertonswife2_28_Merton_NPC=Get out!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_1_Merton_NPC=Hello again! I hear you're the terror of the Badlands.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_Any_Default=We're getting by.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_Any_Default=Did you hear about a lost god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_Merton_NPC=Sure - if you're ready to die!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_Any_Default=We're not green anymore, Merton.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_Merton_NPC=Fine, but the Lost God? That is the stuff of legend.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_7_Merton_NPC=I've met a lot of people who wanted to find that temple.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_8_Merton_NPC=At first I tried to help. No one ever came back.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_9_Merton_NPC=So I decided to stop talking about it.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_10_Merton_NPC=I felt… well…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_11_Any_Default=Responsible for their deaths?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_12_Merton_NPC=Responsible? No - they paid for their folly.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_13_Merton_NPC=I just grew tired of repeating the same warning over and over.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_14_Any_Default=Are we bothering you?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_15_Merton_NPC=You're always bothering me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_16_Any_Default=Let's go.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_17_Merton_NPC=Oh, don't be so sensitive!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_18_Merton_NPC=All right - the temple is real. I've seen it.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_19_Any_Default=You have?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_20_Merton_NPC=It was about fifteen years ago, but yes. I did.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_21_Any_Default=And you didn't raid it?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_22_Merton_NPC=Well, ten of us found the place…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_23_Merton_NPC=…when I was the only one left, I came home.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_24_Any_Default=The other nine died?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_25_Merton_NPC=Slaughtered. All of them.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_26_Merton_NPC=Still interested?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_27_Any_Default=You think we're not strong enough?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_28_Merton_NPC=I don't know. You're the mighty Sorak killers, after all…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_29_Merton_NPC=…maybe with me… you'd have a chance.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_30_Any_Default=You'd come with us?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_31_Merton_NPC=I wouldn't let anyone raid that temple without me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_32_Merton_NPC=You'd never find it, for a start.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_33_Any_Default=Are you after the treasure?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_34_Merton_NPC=Who says there's any treasure?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_35_Merton_NPC=There's a monster - I know that.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_36_Any_NPC=What is it?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_37_Merton_NPC=That, I don't know.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_38_Merton_NPC=I just want to be there first. I want that on my tombstone.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_39_Any_Default=Fair enough.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_40_Merton_NPC=It's a long trip. If you're crazy enough to go, give me some time to pack my gear.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_41_Merton_NPC=I need the rest of the day. I'll wait for you here.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_42_Any_Default=Sure.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_1_Authority_Normal=We're ready to take on that quest, Arwin.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_2_Merton_NPC=Good for you!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_3_Friendly_Normal=Did you change your mind?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_4_Merton_NPC=No, no. I'm ready!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_5_Merton_NPC=Let's go!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_6_Lawful_Normal=Hey, we're supposed to go together, remember?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_7_Merton_NPC=Yeah, about that. I have to go to Coparann first.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_8_Cynical_Normal=Oh - unfinished business, maybe?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_9_Merton_NPC=You know exactly what business.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_10_Authority_Normal=So how about the quest?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_11_Merton_NPC=Your map has a location called Caer Elis.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_12_History_Normal=It's just an old Manacalon name.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_13_Merton_NPC=Maybe, but there is a ruin - you'll see it. It's Tirmarian.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_14_Merton_NPC=I'll be waiting for you.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_15_Selfpres_Normal=What if we don't come?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_16_Merton_NPC=Then damn the lot of you.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_17_Authority_Normal=What we get there before you do?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_18_Merton_NPC=Ha, ha! As if you could!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_19_Merton_NPC=See you there!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_20_Selfpres_Normal=He's crazy.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_2_21_Pragmatic_Normal=And we're going with him.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_1_Merton_NPC=See? I told you I'd be here.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_2_Nosy_Normal=What have you been doing?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_3_Merton_NPC=Catching up with wildlife.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_4_Merton_NPC=It used to be my thing.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_5_Cynical_Normal=Camping in the Badlands? Really?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_6_Merton_NPC=Yep. Shadow Tamer, they called me.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_7_Pragmatic_Normal=Fine, Shadow Tamer - where's the temple?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_3_8_Merton_NPC=Behind the mist.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_1_Pragmatic_Normal=We're through the mist!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_2_Merton_NPC=Don't get too cocky. This is where my friends died last time.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_3_Religion_Einar_Normal=Einar will guide us.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_4_Religion_Maraike_Normal=Maraike is with us.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_5_Religion_Pakri_Normal=Pakri will clear our minds.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_6_Religion_Arun_Normal=Arun will guide our hearts.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_7_Sellsword_Normal=No pain, no gain.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_8_Selpres_Normal=Thanks for the encouragement.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_4_9_Merton_NPC=Just saying…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_1_Selfpres_Normal=We did it!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_2_Merton_NPC=Yeah, we did!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_3_Merton_NPC=There's still the big one, in there!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_4_Pragmatic_Normal=Sure. It's not over yet.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_5_Any_Normal=This is weird. I don't recognize any of these symbols.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_6_Any_Normal=Was there really a lost god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_7_History_Normal=I think I know what this was:
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_8_History_Normal=A temple of Arivad!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_9_Einar_Normal=Einar protect us!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_10_Any_Normal=Isn't that one of the names of the Sorak god?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_11_History_Normal=Not before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_12_History_Normal=Arivad was fierce and just on Tirmar - a god of inquisitors.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_13_History_Normal=Before he was corrupted.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_14_History_Normal=His good side became Einar.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_15_History_Normal=His bad side was absorbed by Sorr-Tarr and they became one.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_16_Einar_Normal=The name of Arivad is cursed. This place is… evil.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_17_History_Normal=This is just stone, transported here from Tirmar.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_18_History_Normal=Whatever took place within these walls happened a millennium ago.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_19_Einar_Normal=Such evil never fully disappears.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_5_20_Lawful_Normal=Well, then - let's clean the place up!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_1_Merton_NPC=Well, I must say…
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_2_Merton_NPC=You're the best team I ever had.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_3_Friendly_Normal=Thanks!
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_4_Friendly_Formal=From a living legend like you, that's a great compliment.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_5_Merton_NPC=Now, it's time to take your reward.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_6_Any_Normal=You're leaving?
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_7_Merton_NPC=I told you. This is it for me - killing that remorhaz, climbing those stairs.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_8_Merton_NPC=I need to tell someone. I'll see you back at Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_9_Selfpres_Normal=Mysterious.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_10_Pragmatic_Normal=Crazy but… a damn good ranger.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_11_Nosy_Normal=He's going back to that Bitterroot woman.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_12_Lawful_Normal=That's none of our business.
Narration/&LegendaryQuest_6_13_Greed_Normal=Indeed. That chest on the other hand…
Narration/&TheAerElai1_Nosy_Default=Look at that…
Narration/&TheAerElai2_Nosy_Default=…the heart of the Badlands, almost the epicenter of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&TheAerElai3_Selfpres_Default=There's nothing left of the Old Empire.
Narration/&TheAerElai4_Authority_Default=All right, people - we're not here for the view.
Narration/&TheAerElai5_Arcana_Default=This wind… it's not natural.
Narration/&TheAerElai6_Arcana_Default=It's a mana wind. We can't use magic to get across.
Narration/&TheAerElai7_Cynical_Default=So, falling would be a bad idea, then.
Narration/&TheAerElai8_Lawful_Default=We've been through worse.
Narration/&TheAerElai9_Selfpres_Default=Watch out!
Narration/&TheAerElai10_Nosy_Default=What kind of creature lives in a place like this?
Narration/&TheAerElai11_Nature_Default=You got it: fire spiders.
Narration/&TheAerElai12_Selfpres_Default=Over there! Soraks!
Narration/&TheAerElai13_Einar_Default=They don't need to hide here.
Narration/&TheAerElai14_Pragmatic_Default=They're not paying attention. What are they doing?
Narration/&TheAerElai15_Cynical_Default=Dropping gigantic bones into lava?
Narration/&TheAerElai16_Pragmatic_Default=Why?
Narration/&TheAerElai17_Nature_Default=They're not just any bones…
Narration/&TheAerElai18_Nature_Default=…those are dragon bones!
Narration/&TheAerElai19_Pragmatic_Default=How many dragons died here?
Narration/&TheAerElai20_Arcana_Default=Remember what the Princess said. The place is deadly to them.
Narration/&TheAerElai21_Authority_Default=There's no other way - we need to get up there!
Narration/&TheAerElai22_Cynical_Default=Without being shot at, preferably?
Narration/&TheAerElai23_Cynical_Default=More dragon bones?
Narration/&TheAerElai24_Pragmatic_Default=That's really what they were doing - cleaning up the place!
Narration/&TheAerElai25_Authority_Default=They were destroying the bones!
Narration/&TheAerElai26_Nosy_Default=How do you know?
Narration/&TheAerElai27_Arcana_Default=The bones are a threat to them!
Narration/&TheAerElai28_Pragmatic_Default=I don't follow.
Narration/&TheAerElai29_Arcana_Default=These are the remains of the Masters of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&TheAerElai30_Pragmatic_Default=Dragons? All of them?
Narration/&TheAerElai31_Arcana_Default=The Master of Abjuration was no exception. They were all dragons.
Narration/&TheAerElai32_Arcana_Default=Even the Magister.
Narration/&TheAerElai33_Arcana_Default=And his bones are among those.
Narration/&TheAerElai34_Pragmatic_Default=I thought I felt something, but…
Narration/&TheAerElai35_Cynical_Default=Definitely.
Narration/&TheAerElai36_Authority_Default=We need to search the bones.
Narration/&TheAerElai37_Any_Default=Here!
Narration/&TheAerElai38_Any2_Default=A tooth?
Narration/&TheAerElai39_Any3_Default=It calls to me…
Narration/&TheAerElai40_Magister_NPC=Let me… touch my Crown…
Narration/&TheAerElai41_Any_Default=Did you hear that?
Narration/&TheAerElai42_Any2_Default=I did.
Narration/&TheAerElai43_Any3_Default=He wants to touch the Crown.
Narration/&TheAerElai44_Any4_Default=The tooth? Just one little tooth?
Narration/&TheAerElai45_Any3_Default=That's why the Soraks want to destroy the bones.
Narration/&TheAerElai46_Any2_Default=What will happen if we succeed?
Narration/&TheAerElai47_Magister_NPC=Let me… touch my Crown…
Narration/&TheAerElai48_Authority_Default=There's only one way to find out.
Narration/&TheAerElai49_Selfpres_Default=This place never ends!
Narration/&TheAerElai50_Any2_Default=This is the way - I can hear the Crown!
Narration/&TheAerElai51_Any3_Default=Yes! We must go on!
Narration/&TheAerElai52_Selfpres_Default=Are we walking into some gigantic trap?
Narration/&TheAerElai53_Pragmatic_Default=The Soraks are doing all they can to stop us!
Narration/&TheAerElai54_Authority_Default=Come on - don't falter now!
Narration/&TheAerElai55_Any_Default=This is it - the Rift!
Narration/&TheAerElai56_Selfpres_Default=Is it open again?
Narration/&TheAerElai57_Any_Default=Hard to say.
Narration/&TheAerElai58_Any_Default=I see a bunch of Soraks, but not the countless horde they're expecting.
Narration/&TheAerElai59_Cynical_Default=And no god.
Narration/&TheAerElai60_Any_Default=The Crown!
Narration/&TheAerElai61_Any_Default=They're doing it - the damn ritual!
Narration/&TheAerElai62_Any_Default=This is it, friends. This is when we make history - or die.
Narration/&TheAerElai63_AcolyteEinar_Default=Einar guide us!
Narration/&TheAerElai64_AcolyteMaraike_Default=Maraike watch over us!
Narration/&TheAerElai65_AcolyteArun_Default=Arun lights our way!
Narration/&TheAerElai66_AcolytePakri_Default=Justice will prevail!
Narration/&TheAerElai67_Highclass_Default=For all my ancestors, I shall not fail!
Narration/&TheAerElai68_Sellsword_Default=To the bitter end!
Narration/&TheAerElai69_Lowlife_Default=Let's make this bitch pay once and for all.
Narration/&TheAerElai70_Spy_Default=Let's neutralize this guy.
Narration/&TheAerElai71_Academic_Default=If we were destined to fail, we would have perished already.
Narration/&TheAerElai72_Philosopher_Default=We'll venture where no one has been before!
Narration/&TheAerElai73_Lawmaker_Default=This chaos will end - today!
Narration/&TheAerElai74_Any_Default=We did it!
Narration/&TheAerElai75_Any2_Default=The Magister!
Narration/&TheAerElai76_Any2_Default=He's coming back to life!
Narration/&TheAerElai77_Magister_NPC=Hold.
Narration/&TheAerElai78_Any3_Default=What?
Narration/&TheAerElai79_Any4_Default=The Rift, it's open!
Narration/&TheAerElai80_Any3_Default=No!
Narration/&TheAerElai81_Magister_NPC=HOLD.
Narration/&TheAerElai82_Any_Default=I thought that was it!
Narration/&TheAerElai83_Any2_Default=He said hold! We need to hold!
Narration/&TheAerElai84_Any_Default=Against a whole army?
Narration/&TheAerElai85_Any3_Default=Look!
Narration/&TheAerElai86_Any3_Default=He's closing the Rift!
Narration/&TheAerElai87_Authority_Default=Protect the Magister - nothing else matters!
Narration/&TheAerElai88_Magister_NPC=I was right about you.
Narration/&TheAerElai89_Magister_NPC=I must go, now.
Narration/&TheAerElai90_Magister_NPC=Take care of Solasta. Take care of your world.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_1_Starter_Default=Hello Annie.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_2_Quartermaster_NPC=You're back! How did it go?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_3_Starter_Default=Well… Captain Henrik is dead, I'm sorry.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_4_Quartermaster_NPC=Oh. Who's in charge, then?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_5_Starter_Default=You might have to wait before going to Caer Lem, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_6_Quartermaster_NPC=I see.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_7_Quartermaster_NPC=Well, not your fault. Thanks for the heads-up.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_02_8_Starter_Default=You're welcome.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_1_Starter_Default=We wanted to talk about Caer Lem.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_2_Quartermaster_NPC=I'm all ears.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_3_Starter_Default=No one's there anymore…
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_4_Quartermaster_NPC=Ah, you want to claim the place?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_5_Starter_Default=How does it work again?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_6_Quartermaster_NPC=We go there and scavenge everything you didn't take, then you get a percentage.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_7_Starter_Default=We can't promise you it's safe.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_8_Quartermaster_NPC=It never is.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_9_Quartermaster_NPC=Once we get there, we'll set up an outpost of our own.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_10_Quartermaster_NPC=I'll check with the Council first, but thanks anyway.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_11_Starter_Default=What do we do next?
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_12_Quartermaster_NPC=Once we've done our work, I'll let you know.
Narration/&Scavengers_Dialog_03_13_Quartermaster_NPC=You'll just have to come by and collect your share.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_01=I think… this is what the Crown showed me.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_02=So, not one of the gems?
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_03=Obviously.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_04=Do you feel anything else?
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_05=Yes.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_06=Alright - let's go, then.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_07=I'm afraid not.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_08=That's a problem.
Narration/&Generic_False_Gem_Thread_09=Let's go back to the Council. We have to tell them.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_1_Annie_NPC=I have great need of you, my friends.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_2_Any_Default=What's going on?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_3_Annie_NPC=One of our teams has been attacked and is stranded in the Badlands.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_4_Any_Default=Oh, where?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_5_Annie_NPC=It's a bit beyond Caer Lem, not that far into the Badlands.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_6_Annie_NPC=They found a legendary place - the lost city of Telema!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_7_Annie_NPC=No one really knows what it was, but the name appears in many old texts.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_8_Annie_NPC=So they started exploring.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_9_Annie_NPC=One of them came back yesterday…
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_10_Annie_NPC=…he had lost an arm.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_11_Annie_NPC=He told me they'd been attacked and his leader sent him to get help.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_12_Annie_NPC=Alas, Telema is many days from here.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_13_Any_Default=Do you think they're still alive?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_14_Annie_NPC=I don't know, but I'd like you to go and find out.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_15_Annie_NPC=If they're alive, bring them back.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_16_Annie_NPC=If not… I'll send for their bodies.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_17_Annie_NPC=Anyway, the place is yours to explore. I expect it contains many treasures.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_18_Any_Default=Well, I suppose we can do that for our friends the Scavengers.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_19_Annie_NPC=That would make you part of the family, I promise.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_Start_20_Any_Default=All right, let's hope we find them alive.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_1_Cynical_Default=Good old Hector, eh?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_2_Any_Default=Let's search him. We might find something to explain all this.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_3_Any_Default=Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_4_Any_Default=Soraks?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_5_Any_Default=At least we saved two of them.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_6_Cynical_Default=The best ones, I'm sure.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_7_Judgmental_Default=Shut up!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_EndHector_8_Any_Default=Let's go back and tell Annie.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_1_Annie_NPC=My friends, you did it!
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_2_Any_Default=Lena and Dek are already here?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_3_Annie_NPC=I received a message. They're safely back in Coparann.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_4_Any_Default=So they told you about Hector.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_5_Annie_NPC=Yes. Another friend lost…
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_6_Any_Default=You mean Arwin Merton?
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_7_Annie_NPC=Never mind me. This was the Soraks, I know.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_8_Any_Default=Actually, we found proof that it was.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_9_Annie_NPC=Oh… and you saved two of my kids, I shall never forget.
Narration/&ScavengersQuestTelema_End_10_Any_Default=We must go, Annie. See you!
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_1_Any_Default=Are you the local… boss of the Scavengers?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_2_Milan_NPC=You could say that.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_3_Milan_NPC=Not boss of much, I'm afraid.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_4_Milan_NPC=We used to have adventurers raiding around here, but now there's just one.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_5_Any_Default=One?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_6_Milan_NPC=She's around somewhere. You might run into her.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_7_Any_Default=We did find an interesting place, though - an old Tirmarian monastery.
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_8_Milan_NPC=Yeah?
Narration/&ScavengersCoparann_9_Milan_NPC=Tell me where. We'll take care of it.
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri1_Priestess_NPC=The law provides, adventurers!
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri2_Pakri_Default=Pakri preserve us!
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri4_Priestess_NPC=May the owl watch over you, faithful one.
Narration/&PriestessOfPakri3_Priestess_NPC=May you find the answers you seek, adventurers.
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike1_Priest_NPC=There's life yet, adventurers!
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike2_Maraike_Default=Maraike smile on you!
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike3_Priest_NPC=Lady of life! A follower of the goddess.
Narration/&PriestOfMaraike4_Priest_NPC=Walk in life, adventurers.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_1_MayorBrightspark_NPC=Ah - deputies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_2_Philosopher_Default=Clear skies, lady mayor!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_3_MayorBrightspark_NPC=Hem. Well, a renowned mind of Caer Cyflen has asked to see you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_4_MayorBrightspark_NPC=I believe you know him - Galeafin Pureheart?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_5_Philosopher_Default=Indeed! A very fine mind and a beloved teacher!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_6_MayorBrightspark_NPC=Well, he's heard about your exploits and would like to talk to you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_7_Philosopher_Default=Gladly! It will be good to see my old teacher! Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_QuestGiver_8_MayorBrightspark_NPC=Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_1_Philosopher_Default=Clear skies! We would like to meet Master Pureheart!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_2_Butler_NPC=You don't have an appointment? Who shall I announce?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_3_Philosopher_Default=A companion of the third enlightenment!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_4_GaleafinPureheart_NPC=Clear skies, my student! To what do I owe the pleasure?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_5_Philosopher_Default=Mayor Bright-Spark asked us to visit you.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_6_GaleafinPureheart_NPC=Ah yes, this matter for the Council!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_7_Philosopher_Default=What matter?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_8_GaleafinPureheart_NPC=The matter of evil, and what motivates people to choose evil.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_9_Philosopher_Default=A weighty matter indeed!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_10_GaleafinPureheart_NPC=Yes, and I need your help! Tell me about your missions!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_11_GaleafinPureheart_NPC=I am cleared to hear everything!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_12_Philosopher_Default=Well… it all began at Caer Lem…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_13_GaleafinPureheart_NPC=Many thanks! You gave me much to ponder. We shall meet again soon!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_14_Philosopher_Normal=Clear skies, master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_MeetingPureheart_15_GaleafinPureheart_NPC=Clear skies to you!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_1_Philosopher_Normal=Clear skies, Master Pureheart. You sent for us?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC=Yes, indeed! I would like more…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC=…details about your dealings with the Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_4_Philosopher_Normal=Certainly. How goes your research?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC=You gave me much to consider. But I need more…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_6_Galeafin_NPC=…hence this invitation
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC=There is much talk about Sorr-Akkath cruelty…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC=Did you witness it first hand?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_9_Philosopher_Normal=Alas, quite often! When they fight…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_10_Philosopher_Normal=They enjoy inflicting pain before killing!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC=But why, why so much suffering?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_12_Philosopher_Normal=We think it is the will of their god, Sorr-Tarr.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_13_Galeafin_NPC=He expects them to spread terror…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_14_Philosopher_Normal=…so he can influence and…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_15_Philosopher_Normal=…pervert humans… control them.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_16_Galeafin_NPC=Humans, you say?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_17_Philosopher_Normal=Yes - others seem less susceptible…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_18_Philosopher_Normal=… from what we understand of them!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_19_Galeafin_NPC=And so he relies on cruelty to… to do what?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_20_Philosopher_Normal=To gain a hold! Those he can't control, he blackmails or breaks their will!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_21_Galeafin_NPC=Fascinating…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_22_Philosopher_Normal=Does it help?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_23_Galeafin_NPC=Oh, yes, very much.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_24_Galeafin_NPC=Thank you very much.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_SecondMeeting_25_Philosopher_Normal=Until next time, then, Master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_1_Philosopher_Default=Clear skies, Master!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_2_Galeafin_NPC=Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_3_Galeafin_NPC=We live in fascinating times!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_4_Philosopher_Default=Too true!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_5_Galeafin_NPC=So, about our last meeting…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_6_Philsopher_Insight_Success_Automatic_Default=Still troubled, Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_7_Galeafin_NPC=Yes, indeed.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_8_Galeafin_NPC=I have had occasion to witness… certain things.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_9_Philosopher_Default=What things?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_10_Galeafin_NPC=I am not entirely sure. Violent rituals…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_11_Galeafin_NPC=…they reminded me of what you said.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_12_Galeafin_NPC=About cruelty and Sorr-Tarr's ways.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_13_Philosopher_Default=Master! You're scaring me, now!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_14_Galeafin_NPC=I need to think! Can you come back tomorrow?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_15_Philosopher_Default=Of course!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_16_Any_Default=You realize something very bad might be happening to him?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_ThirdMeeting_17_Philosopher_Default=I know. Let's just… come back tomorrow.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_1_Philosopher_Default=Clear skies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_2_Galeafin_NPC=Ah, my friend. Let me introduce Lady Illoreth, my paramour!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_3_Philosopher_Default=Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_4_Illoreth_NPC=Clear skies, senior deputies!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_5_Philosopher_Default=Why do you call us that?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_6_Illoreth_NPC=Because you are the reason I was sent after Galeafin, the most gentle soul on Solasta.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_7_InsightSuccessDC15_Default=I knew there was some treachery afoot here!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_8_InsightFailDC15_Default=What?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_9_Philosopher_Default=You'd better explain yourself quickly!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_10_Illoreth_NPC=I am an infiltrator from the Coven of Arivad!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_11_Selfpres_Default=They're here in Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_12_Illoreth_NPC=I was to seduce Galeafin to make him work for us!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_13_Illoreth_NPC=But instead, he changed me!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_14_Illoreth_NPC=He showed me that even a corrupted soul like mine still had some good.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_15_Illoreth_NPC=And I won't let any harm come to him!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_16_Philosopher_Default=How can we believe you?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_17_Illoreth_NPC=I am not the danger!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_18_Illoreth_NPC=The Coven will soon ask me to bring him in to turn him!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_19_Philosopher_Default=And?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_20_Illoreth_NPC=I can take you there - right to a splinter cell of the Coven!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_21_InsightSuccessDC15_Default=What do you want?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_22_Illoreth_NPC=Just to be free - to make a new life somewhere else.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_23_Illoreth_NPC=We are too well known to stay here, but we want to stay together!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_24_Illoreth_NPC=The Coven knew of your mission and sent me to get information from you…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_25_Illoreth_NPC=I am not sure I am the only agent who knows…
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_26_Illoreth_NPC=…and Galeafin must disappear to be safe.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_27_Philosopher_Default=Do you truly want to leave, Master?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_28_Galeafin_NPC=Yes. Where Illoreth goes, I shall follow!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Showdown_29_Philosopher_Default=Very well, we shall come when you send for us!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_1_Philosopher_Default=Is it time?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_3_Philosopher_Default=And once inside?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_4_Illoreth_NPC=Wait for my signal!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven_5_Illoreth_NPC=And until then, let me speak.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_1_Guard_NPC=State your business!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_2_Illoreth_NPC=Glory of souls!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_3_Guard_NPC=Power to the One!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_4_Illoreth_NPC=We're running late! Are we the last?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_5_Guard_NPC=Yes! All are awaiting your guest.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_7_Illoreth_NPC=New recruits.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_8_Guard_NPC=It's one at a time, you know the rules!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_9_Illoreth_NPC=Indeed, I know them.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_10_Illoreth_BANTER=Follow me to the basement.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_TheCoven2_11_Sarcastic_BANTER=Let me guess - that was the signal!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_1_Any_Default=Look at this! Marshal Sunblaze will be delighted!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_2_Cynical_Default=Or scared to death!
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_3_Selfpres_Default=Where's Illoreth?
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_4_Any_Default=I suppose she grabbed her reward… she ran.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_5_Philosopher_Default=Farewell, Master.
Narration/&PhilosopherBackgroundQuest_Ending_6_Philosopher_Default=May your wisdom serve you well, now.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_01_Default=What's this? A shrine?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_02_Default=Someone here worshipped Arun, a long time ago.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_03_Default=That someone ruined their own shrine?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_04_Default=Maybe it was just the cataclysm.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Monastery_05_Default=There's a small chest, here.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_1_Acolyte_Default=Clear skies, Chaplain Lark! You wanted to see me?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_2_DalonLark_NPC=Clear skies! Yes, thank you for coming so fast.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_3_DalonLark_NPC=Remember that monastery near Coparann?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_4_Acolyte_Default=The Tirmarian ruins? Of course.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_5_DalonLark_NPC=There was a cemetery there.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_6_Acolyte_Default=Chaplain Ardentfire, Priest of Arun, would like to meet you about it.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_7_DalonLark_NPC=I shall go to him right away! Clear skies!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_8_Acolyte_Default=Even if I don't pray to Arun, I'm happy to be of service.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Mission_9_DalonLark_NPC=Clear skies! Einar guards you all!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC=Ah, there you are!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default=Chaplain Dalon Lark told us you'd like to talk?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC=Many thanks for coming!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Rogar_NPC=It's about the Sunblaze Monastery.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Acolyte_Default=We're all ears!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC=The Scavengers said that many tombs in the cemetery bore the name of the Darwaz family.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Acolyte_Default=And?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_8_Rogar_NPC=Emtan Darwaz ruled this monastery…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_9_Rogar_NPC=He was a renowned prelate on Tirmar.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_10_Rogar_NPC=The heads of the Church searched for him for years.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_11_Rogar_NPC=Then he was considered to be lost, either left on the home world…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_12_Rogar_NPC=…or killed in the Cataclysm.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_13_Rogar_NPC=Now, we know he was alive - he buried his brothers and family in the Badlands!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_14_Acolyte_Default=A sad tale, for sure.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_15_Rogar_NPC=Worse. As this cursed symbol suggests.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_16_Rogar_NPC=I prayed for his soul, and Arun sent me a sign.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_17_Acolyte_Default=A sign?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_18_Rogar_NPC=Chaplain Darwaz' soul never joined Arun. It is trapped.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_19_Rogar_NPC=He might have cursed his own symbol.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_20_Rogar_NPC=The souls of his brothers too, wander, somewhere in this land.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_21_Rogar_NPC=Someone needs to go and cleanse their remains with holy water.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_22_Acolyte_Default=Will that suffice?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_23_Rogar_NPC=Not if Emtan is indeed cursed, his soul will be too angry.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_24_Rogar_NPC=Then you'll need to reason with him. I imbued his symbol with Arun's magic - use it as proof.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_25_Acolyte_Default=And if he doesn't listen to reason?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_26_Rogar_NPC=Then - and only then - should you destroy him.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_27_Acolyte_Default=We will do what is necessary.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_28_Rogar_NPC=May Arun's fire warm your heart!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Rogar_29_Acolyte_Default=Clear skies!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_1_Sarcastic_Default=Did we forget to close the door on our last visit?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_2_HighestIntOrAny_Default=Never opened it!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_3_Sarcastic_Default=Well, someone's dropped by!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_5_Acolyte_Default=Let's cleanse those tombs with holy water!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_6_Sarcastic_Default=Not many remains left for the prayer!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_7_Acolyte_Default=You had to say it! Get ready, people!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_8_Sarcastic_Default=We're not going to try talking to them first?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9a_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Success_Default=Zombies don't talk!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_9b_AcolyteIfReligionDC10Failure_Default=No harm in trying, I guess.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_11_Acolyte_Default=May the light of the gods free your souls!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_Cemetary_12_Sarcastic_Default=Sheesh! Don't pray for me if I die!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_1_Emtan_NPC=Who are you to disturb our eternal rest?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_2_Acolyte_Default=A follower of the gods, hoping to save your soul!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_3_Emtan_NPC=There are no gods in this place, fool!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_4_Acolyte_Default=Do you truly believe that?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Emtan_NPC=Of course! Otherwise, they would have answered us in our hour of need!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5_Acolyte_Default=Did they not?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_5b_Emtan_NPC=I prayed and never got an answer!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6a_Acolyte_Default=Yes, it did!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7a_Emtan_NPC=Liar!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8a_Acolyte_Default=Did you not have water and the means to grow food?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9a_Emtan_NPC=Barely!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8b_Acolyte_Default=Were monsters not kept at bay from your valley?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9b_Emtan_NPC=We heard them roam at night!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_8c_Acolyte_Default=Weren't you spared the worst of the mana collapse?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_9c_Emtan_NPC=What?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_10_Acolyte_Default=And yet you survived how many years here?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_11_Emtan_NPC=But my prayers weren't answered!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_12_Acolyte_Default=Yes, they were! You were just too mad with grief to see it!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_6b_Acolyte_Default=Behold, the power of Arun, apostate!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_7b_Emtan_NPC=It won't work, you fool!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_13_Emtan_NPC=Arun! The lord is still here!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_14_Acolyte_Default=It is time for you to enjoy your final rest, Emtan Darwaz, Acolyte of Arun!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_MeetEmtan_15_Emtan_NPC=Thank you…
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Acolyt_Normal=Clear skies, Chaplain Ardentfire!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_1_Rogar_NPC=Clear skies! Did you bring peace to those troubled souls?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_2_Acolyte_Default=Yes, all of them are with the gods now!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_3_Rogar_NPC=And Emtan?
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_4_Acolyt_Normal=Saved. He is with Arun.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_5_Rogar_NPC=Many thanks, I will call his name during prayers!
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_6_Rogar_NPC=Tragedy. The curse of Sorr-Tarr hurts us, still.
Narration/&BackgroundQuest_End_Acolyte_Rogar_7_Failed=We couldn't bring him back. He's gone.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest1_Belmont_NPC=You? I know you!
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest2_Spy_Default=What?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest3_Belmont_NPC=You were at the embassy! An aide or something…
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest4_Spy_Default=You're mistaken. I'm a Council deputy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest5_Belmont_NPC=You can't fool me, I never forget a face.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest6_Anyother_Default=What's going on, friend?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest7_Spy_Default=Never mind.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest8_Belmont_NPC=That same week, the Gallivan envoy somehow got hold of our plans for the trade treaty…
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest9_Spy_Default=Stop bothering us - we're guests of the princess.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest10_Noble_Default=He's a Belmont. Be careful - they're a powerful family in the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest11_Belmont_NPC=This isn't over. Now I found you, we'll settle this!
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest12_Anyother_Default=Anything we should know?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest13_Spy_Default=Old story.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest14_Anyother_Default=Look, if this is going to be a problem, we need to fix it - together.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest15_Anyother_Default=I agree.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest16_Spy_Default=All right, then I'll need to see someone at the Gallivan embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest17_Guard_NPC=Who goes there?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest18_Spy_Default=I'd like to see Ambassador Crawley.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest19_Guard_NPC=Council business?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest20_Spy_Default=Inaudible
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest21_Guard_NPC=Follow me.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest22_Anyother_Default=Just like that?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest23_Spy_Default=Shut up and follow.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest24_Joran_NPC=I'll be damned. Senior deputy of the Legacy Council.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest25_Spy_Default=Nice to see you, too.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest26_Joran_NPC=Can't say I expected your visit.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest27_Spy_Default=I bumped into Belmont at the Palace residence.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest28_Joran_NPC=And?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest29_Spy_Default=He seems to suspect me over the stolen treaty plans.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest30_Joran_NPC=Seems to?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest31_Spy_Default=He's pretty eager to pin it on me.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest32_Joran_NPC=We can't let that happen.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest33_Spy_Default=That's why I'm here.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest34_Joran_NPC=Them?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest35_Spy_Default=Friends. Trustworthy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest36_Joran_NPC=You have to take him out.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest37_Joran_NPC=I can suggest a course of action.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest38_Joran_NPC=You just need to plant something in the New Empire's embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest39_Spy_Default=Oh, is that all?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest40_Joran_NPC=Unless you have friends in the Silent Whisper.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest41_Spy_Default=I might.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest42_Joran_NPC=Once it's in the right hands, this will kill our friend Belmont's credibility.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest43_Spy_Default=It looks like you have this all figured out.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest44_Joran_NPC=I always plan for every contingency.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest45_Joran_NPC=We should go.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest46_Joran_NPC=Then this time it's farewell for good.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest47_Selfpres_Default=You really want to break into the New Empire's embassy?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest48_Pragmatic_Default=This is crazy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest49_Spy_DaliatLives=We can ask Daliat. I think he'll help us.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest50_Starter_Normal=That's not an embassy.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest51_Spy_Normal=Just not its best side.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest52_Noble_Slang=Sewers? Really? How did you know about this?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest53_Spy_Slang=Mind your own business. This way. Stay low.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest54_Spy_Formal=Remember, if we're discovered, we're as good as dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest55_Spy_Formal=This is it.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest56_Spy_Normal=Let's hope this works.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest57_Spy_Slang=Let's get out of here.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest58_Daliat_NPC=Greetings, colleague.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest59_Spy_Default=I'm not your colleague, Daliat. You know that.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest60_Daliat_NPC=Sure. What can I do for you?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest61_Spy_Default=You know Lord Belmont?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest62_Daliat_NPC=Ambassador Belmont? Of course.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest63_Spy_Default=We have something on Belmont that you might like. Not flattering.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest64_Daliat_NPC=Nice. What's the catch?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest65_Spy_Default=I need you to release it right away.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest66_Daliat_NPC=Right now? No long-term leverage?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest67_Spy_Default=That's right.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest68_Daliat_NPC=I'll need you to do something for me, then.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest69_Spy_Default=I'm listening.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest70_Daliat_NPC=Some… former colleagues are running an operation from a base nearby.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest71_Daliat_NPC=I need them dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest72_Spy_Default=We're not murderers.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest73_Daliat_NPC=They're traitors to the Silent Whisper. Ruthless bastards, too.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest74_Spy_Default=Enough to die, just like that?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest75_Daliat_Default=Your choice. Do this for me and I'll take care of the Belmont thing.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest76_Spy_Default=Fair enough.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest77_Spy_Default=Hey! Any news?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest78_Daliat_NPC=It's done. Your… friends won't be a problem anymore.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest79_Spy_Default=Good! I knew I could depend on you.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest80_Daliat_NPC=That tip on Belmont is so good. He's as good as dead.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest81_Daliat_NPC=Pleasure working with you, my friends.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest82_Spy_Default=See you, Daliat.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest83_Spy_Default=Is Lord Belmont around?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest84_Butler_NPC=He had to… return home.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest85_Spy_Default=In a rush?
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest86_Butler_NPC=Indeed.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest87_Spy_Default=Thank you, Ravensworth.
Narration/&Optional_Spy_Quest88_Butler_NPC=You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_1_Bagmordah_NPC=Clear skies, friends! I have a letter for someone who fought at Sandreed.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_2_Sellsword_Normal=That'd be me. Who wrote me?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_3_Bagmordah_NPC=Mildred Warmhearth, innkeeper at Coparann's Strike True tavern. Know her?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_ScavengersOutpost_4_Sellsword_Normal=Sure do. Well, friends, who's in for a trip back there?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Clear skies to you, adventurers! You got my letter?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_6_Sellsword_Normal=Clear skies! What's it all about?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Well, I knew your parents - and I know about the events that led to their deaths!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_8_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=You knew my parents?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_9_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=What events?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN=Their deaths?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_11_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=You knew my parents?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Sure did. They had a house in the Vale, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_13_Sellsword_Normal=A house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=I wasn't sure the first time I saw you… now I am.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Your parents were merchants, and you sometimes traveled with them.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=They worked a circuit from the Principality to the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=They were shrewd and successful.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_18_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=So the house belongs to you now, I guess!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_19_ChoiceB_Normal=What events? What are you talking about?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_20_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Fifteen years ago, Coparann was threatened by an orcish horde.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_21_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=They hit us hard, and almost overran the defenses!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_22_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=If the Stonefist company hadn't shown up when they did…
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_23_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=They broke the siege, but we'd already lost a lot of people.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_24_ChoiceC_Normal=How did they die?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_25_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=They died right after the siege.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_26_Sellsword_Sellsword=After? Not during?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_27_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=No… I… How can I put this?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_28_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Success=They were… responsible.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_29_Sellsword_InsigtDC20Fail=Come on - spit it out!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_30_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=Well, your parents had been spying for the orcs!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_31_Sellsword_Sellsword=What? No! How? Who said?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_32_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=That's the hardest part.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_33_Sellsword_Sellsword=What do you mean?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_34_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=It was you. Your testimony sealed their fate.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_35_Sellsword_Sellsword=What? Me? How?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_36_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=A seemingly innocent remark, but it led the Ceannard's spymaster to suspect your parents.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_37_Sellsword_Sellsword=How is it possible that I don't remember any of it?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_38_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=The Ceannard took pity on you and made you drink an elixir of forgetfulness.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_39_Sellsword_Sellsword=Very potent, clearly. I don't remember shit from my childhood.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_40_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=Yes. The Ceannard miscalculated the dose.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_41_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=The Baron sent you away, and provided for your education.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_42_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=He was a former mercenary, and he sent you to learn the same trade.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_43_Sellsword_Sellsword=I guess I should thank him for bleeding in Sandreed… so, there's a house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_44_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=All yours! No one knew where to find you until now. It's been kept in good order, waiting.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_45_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=Your parents gave me this before they went to meet their fate.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_46_Sellsword_Sellsword=What does that mean, "resist temptation"?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_47_Any_Insight_25_Success_Any_Insight_25_Success=Bribery or Sorak evil perhaps?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_48_Any_Insight_25_Failure_Any_Insight_25_Failure=Bribery?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_49_Sellsword_Sellsword=It was orcs! Let's go search the house for clues!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_CoparannInn_50_MildredWarmhearth_MildredWarmhearth=You should tell Sergeant Nikannen who you are, by the way. I told him you'd come.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_1_Sellsword_Slang=Clear skies to you, Sarge!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC=You, too! What can I do for you today, my friend?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_3_Sellsword_Normal=I need the keys to my house in the Vale. Mildred told me.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_4_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Oh, it's you? You've grown - well, of course you have! Here - take this note to the Archivist!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_EnterHouse_5_Sellsword_Normal=Thanks, Sarge!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_1_Sellsword_Slang=Clear skies, Master Archivist!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_2_AlanMiller_NPC=Clear skies! What can I do for you?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_3_Sellsword_Normal=Here - from Sergeant Nikannen!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_4_AlanMiller_NPC=I see! Give me a moment, I just need to go into the archives.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_5_AlanMiller_NPC=Here you go!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Archivist_6_Sellsword_Normal=Thanks! Clear skies!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_1_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal=Nice house!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_2_Sellsword_Normal=Strange. It feels familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_3_Any_BUT_sellsword_Normal=Let's go inside!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_4_Sellsword_Normal=I got something.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_5_Sellsword_Normal=Some stuff, and a note…
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__1_Any_Default=Soraks!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__2_Any_Default=So they're involved, for sure!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_House_FightEnd__3_Sellsword_Default=I'll find the rest and kill them!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_1_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Clear skies! Did you go to the house?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_2_Sellsword_Normal=Yes - and I found this note!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_3_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Interesting - and surprising!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_4_Sellsword_Normal=Surprising?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_5_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Well, why hide it? They could have shown it to the Ceannard!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_6_Sellsword_Normal=Anyway, this was written by the real spy.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_7_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=So what?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_8_CynicOrElse_Slang=Good luck finding the writer!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_9_Sellsword_Normal=Yes, that's it!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_10_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=What do you mean?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_11_Sellsword_Normal=The note - the writing reveals the spy.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_12_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Then why didn't your parents use it at the trial? It would have saved their lives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_13_Sellsword_Normal=Because they wanted to keep me safe!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_14_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Then they must have known that the spy was present at their trial!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_15_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=You know… paperwork.
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_16_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=The Ceannard, he swears by the rule of law!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_17_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Every trial is recorded. It's all in the archives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_18_Sellsword_Normal=So we have our list of suspects!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_BackToInn_19_MildredWarmhearth_NPC=Exactly!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_1_AllanMiller_NPC=Clear skies! What can I do for you today?
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_2_Sellsword_Normal=We need to consult the archives!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_3_AllanMiller_NPC=Give me the year and the case, and I'll get whatever you need!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_4_AcademicOrElse_Normal=Is that your writing? I've never seen anything so neat!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_5_AllanMiller_NPC=It's my job. An archive needs to be clear and legible!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_6_Sellsword_Slang=Right - so your agents don't misunderstand your orders. Traitor!
Narration/&Optional_Sellsword_Quest_Confrontation_7_AllanMiller_NPC=Ah, you're too smart for you own good.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_1_Ceannard_NPC=Ah - I expected you.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_2_Sellsword_Default=Ceannard.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_3_Ceannard_NPC=You know the truth. I hope you can forgive me.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_4_Ceannard_NPC=To think the Soraks were already here…
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_5_Ceannard_NPC=…manipulating me…
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_6_Sellsword_Default=It's in the past.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_7_Sellsword_Default=Though I'd like you to restore my family's name.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_8_Ceannard_NPC=The paperwork is under way.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_9_Ceannard_NPC=Their names will be on a memorial I intend to build.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_10_Sellsword_Default=Great thanks.
Narration/&Background_Sellsword_End_11_Ceannard_NPC=Clear skies, my friends.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start1_Bagmordah_NPC=Ah, there you are! Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start2_Bagmordah_NPC=Someone came to see you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start3_Academic_Default=Me? Who?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start4_Bagmordah_NPC=An old acquaintance, I gather. Master Dackin.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start5_Bagmordah_NPC=He said he'd wait for you at Sunblaze Court.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start6_Academic_Default=Oh! Thanks for the message. Stay in the light!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start7_Anyother_Default=Everything all right?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Start8_Academic_Default=Like she said - an old acquaintance.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster1_Dackin_NPC=You came! I wondered, considering your new… rank.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster2_Academic_Default=How are you, Master?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster3_Dackin_NPC=It's nice that you pretend to care…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster4_Academic_Default=Are you going to hate me forever?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster5_Dackin_NPC=I don't hate you. I just…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster6_Dackin_NPC=…well, it was your right to leave and…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster7_Dackin_NPC=…pursue a life of adventure.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster8_Dackin_NPC=Even if it wastes your academic talent.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster9_Academic_Default=It serves me well, thanks to you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster10_Dackin_NPC=Maybe. Still, I'm without an assistant.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster11_Dackin_NPC=Times have been hard.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster12_Dackin_NPC=The Guild offered me a posting… south.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster13_Academic_Default=You're not getting your department chair?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster14_Dackin_NPC=Evidently not - unless I can make a major contribution.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster15_Dackin_NPC=That's why I wanted to see you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster16_Dackin_NPC=I heard you went to Caer Lem, in the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster17_Academic_Default=That's right.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster18_Dackin_NPC=There is an old Tirmarian tower there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster19_Academic_Default=Oh, yes. Very impressive, too.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster20_Dackin_NPC=If I could just explore it - bring something back…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster21_Dackin_NPC=Something the Guild couldn't ignore…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster22_Dackin_NPC=I would have a chance at this chair.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster23_Dackin_NPC=The Scavengers say it's safe now. I can go.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster24_Dackin_NPC=But once there, I'll need… well, some specific expertise.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster25_Academic_Default=…and that's us.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster26_Dackin_NPC=It could salvage my career!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster27_Academic_Default=Of course. I owe you that much, Master.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster28_Dackin_NPC=Thanks. Find me at Caer Lem, then. I'll be ready!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_MeetMaster29_Academic_Default=We'll see you there. Stay in the light, Master!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem1_Friendly_Default=Clear skies, friend!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem2_Bertram_NPC=Clear skies, deputy!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem3_Greed_WRITTEN=How's business in Caer Lem?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem4_Friendly_WRITTEN=What's your name?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem5_Nosy_WRITTEN=Did you find the secret passage?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN=Have you seen Master Dackin?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem7_Greed_Choice=How's business been since we… cleaned up the place?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem8_Bertram_NPC=Not bad! Some folks are starting to explore a little further.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem9_Bertram_NPC=Though this… Sorak attack still has people nervous.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem10_Bertram_NPC=Still, there's been no sign of them since…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem11_Bertram_NPC=…so we mostly pretend it didn't happen.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem12_Pragmatic_Default=Huh - good for you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem13_Bertram_NPC=I'm Bertram.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem14_Friendly_Default=Good to meet you, Bertram.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem15_Bertram_NPC=I think so, but… your Sorak buddies seem to have blocked it.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem16_Bertram_NPC=They must have dug a little too hard in there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem17_Greed_Default=I'm sure we can solve this little problem.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem18_Bertram_NPC=The Antiquarian? Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem19_Bertram_NPC=He's in the courtyard.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem20_Bertram_NPC=He's been staring at the tower…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem21_Bertram_NPC=…trying to figure a way to get up there.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem22_Bertram_NPC=But he can't fly… wait, can he?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_ArrivingAtCaerLem23_Academic_Default=Seems not.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster1_Dackin_NPC=There you are!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster2_Academic_Default=Are you ready for this?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster3_Dackin_NPC=I am. Any idea how to get up there?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster4_Academic_Default=One or two.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster5_Dackin_NPC=I tried to think of a way, but…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster6_Dackin_NPC=…still, this place is incredible!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster7_Dackin_NPC=Did you notice that there was minor gate just here in the courtyard?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster8_Academic_Default=As a matter of fact, I did.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_FindMaster9_Pragmatic_Default=Let's get to it, if you don't mind.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower1_Dackin_NPC=Fantastic… it looks like… well, another world.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower2_Dackin_NPC=You must have seen so much!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower3_Academic_Default=I have. But this is still…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower4_Dackin_NPC=…fascinating.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower5_Anyother_Default=Well, I see where you got your passion for learning!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower6_Academic_Default=Let's look around.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_EnterTower7_Academic_Default=Gather all the antiques we can.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary1_Dackin_NPC=By all the gods!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary2_Dackin_NPC=This is really something.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary3_Academic_Default=It explains the library we found down in the caves.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary4_Dackin_NPC=The place seems… dangerous.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary5_Academic_Default=Definitely. Be ready for a fight.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_DiscoverLibrary6_Dackin_NPC=Wait - you know me. I don't fight.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight1_Academic_Default=Are you all right, Master?
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight2_Dackin_NPC=I am… alive, or so it seems.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight3_Academic_Default=Those are quite common in the Marches.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight4_Dackin_NPC=Just tell me there's something valuable down here!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_AfterFight5_Academic_Default=Oh, I think you'll be happy.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending1_Dackin_NPC=This is… more than I dared hope for… so much more!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending2_Academic_Default=Good! I think the Guild will treat you a little better now. They'd lick your boots for a look at these!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending3_Dackin_NPC=I'd like to see them do that - one or two of them, in particular…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending4_Dackin_NPC=These will be perfect! Take whatever else you want - I have plenty!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending5_Dackin_NPC=…And thank you.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending6_Academic_Default=You're welcome, Master.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending7_Dackin_NPC=I think it's time you stop calling me that, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending8_Academic_Default=Well, how about Chairman of the Guild, then? With these books…
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending9_Dackin_NPC=Stay in the light, my friend!
Narration/&Optional_Academic_Quest_Ending10_Academic_Default=You, too!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start1_Merton_NPC=Hey! Interested in a little side-job?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start2_Player_Default=What kind of side-job?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start3_Merton_NPC=The kind that takes particular skills and contacts.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start4_Merton_NPC=In the - shall we say - involuntary gift business.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start5_Player_Default=Involuntary gift business'? That's just embarrassing.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start6_Player_Default=Say what you mean - the underworld, right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start7_Merton_NPC=And there I was trying to be discreet.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start8_Lowlife_Default=Try harder. Suppose I do have the skills and contacts you're looking for?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start9_Merton_NPC=Go to Annie Bagmordah at the Scavengers.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Start10_Merton_NPC=Tell her I sent you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlifeb_Default=Merton says you got a problem.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Annie_NPC=Uh… Arwin…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Annie_NPC=What makes you think you can help?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlifeb_Default=Not saying I can, yet. But I know people.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Annie_NPC=People who can track down stolen goods?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Lowlifeb_Default=What kind of goods?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Annie_NPC=A sword. Imperial.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Annie_NPC=The guard has three diamonds. Probably magical.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Curious_Default=Probably? What does it probably do?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Annie_NPC=Never got a chance to find out.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Greedy_Default=You offering a reward?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Annie_NPC=I'll make it worth your while.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Joker_Default=Are you not the one supposed to bring back stuff?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Annie_NPC=Very funny.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel1_Lowlife_Default=Hey, Nel! Still laughing?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel2_Nel_NPC=Like Misaye herself! You?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel3_Lowlife_NPC=Happy as a rat in a granary. Need an ear out.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel4_Nel_NPC=For?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel5_Lowlife_Default=A nice antique sword with three diamonds.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel6_Lowlife_Default=Hear anything?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel7_Nel_NPC=Something. Talk to Gorim.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel8_Joker_Default=So that's your former life, walking the streets?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetNel9_Lowlife_Default=And cutting the throats of people who crossed me.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie1_Lowlife_Default=Hey, Gorim! I'm in the market for a sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie2_Lowlife_Default=A very particular one.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie3_Gorim_NPC=How particular?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie4_Lowlife_Default=Imperial, three diamonds in the guard, probably magical.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie5_Lowlife_Default=Sound familiar?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie6_Gorim_NPC=Too expensive for me. I turned him down.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie7_Lowlife_Default=He have a name?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie8_Gorim_NPC=Didn't say. I told him to ask for Surespell at the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie9_Gorim_NPC=The Arcaneum has money.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie10_Lowlife_Default=Thanks.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie11_Gorim_NPC=Thank me by buying something.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie12_Lowlife_Default=Another time, but I will.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_MeetAnnie13_Gorim_NPC=I'll remember!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern1_Karel_NPC=Hey, Karel!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern2_Lowlife_Default=Back again?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern3_Karel_NPC=Has anyone been in asking for Surespell?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern4_Karel_NPC=The Arcaneum guy?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern5_Karel_NPC=Yes, as it happens. Over there. Still waiting, it seems.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern6_Lowlife_Default=Thanks.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern7_Lowlife_Default=I've been looking for you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern8_Thief_NPC=I'm waiting for someone, and you're not him. Get lost.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern9_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=You have a stolen sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=Let's make a deal.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern11_ChoiceC_WRITTEN=You're in trouble.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern12_Intimidator_Answer1=Don't come the hard case with me. You won't win.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern13_Intimidator_Answer2=You have a sword that doesn't belong to you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern14_Thief_Success=Listen, I don't want any trouble…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern15_Thief_Failure=You deaf or something? I said, get lost!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern16_Persuader_Answer1=You're waiting for someone to buy a sword.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern17_Persuader_Answer2=Old, three diamonds, probably magical. Am I right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern18_Thief_Success=How do you…?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern19_Thief_Success2=Doesn't matter.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern20_Thief_Success2=What matters is, do you want a Council deputy owing you a favor?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern21_Thief_Success3=It had better be a pretty big favor.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern22_Thief_Failure=I can make better friends than you with a sword like that…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern23_Thief_Failure=…and get paid too!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern24_Deceiver_Answer1=It's about that very nice sword…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern25_Deceiver_Answer2=…that you're thinking of selling…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern26_Deceiver_Answer3=…to Heddlon Surespell of the Arcaneum.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern28_Deceiver_Success2=What matters is, do you want to end up nailed to a door in Fishtown?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern29_Thief_Success3=What?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern30_Deceiver_Success4=You see, the sword was already spoken for when you stole it from the Scavengers…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern31_Deceiver_Success5=…and a certain someone's going to be very disappointed if they don't get it as planned.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern32_Deceiver_Success6=The sort of someone who nails people to doors in Fishtown.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern33_Thief_NPC=Misaye's crooked dice! I… I can get it for you.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern34_Deceiver_Success7=Just tell me where to find it. Then it might be wise to leave town.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern35_Deceiver_Success8=I hear the Southern Isles are lovely at this time of year.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern36_Thief_Failure1=Ooh! I'm so scared. Sell your drivel somewhere else.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern37_Any_Allfailed=Perhaps you missed our nice badge, here.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern38_Thief_NPC=The Council? Oh, come on…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern39_Thief_NPC=It's in Misaye's temple for safekeeping.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern40_Thief_NPC=Ask Nel for a bowl of soup.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Lowlife_Default=Nel? I just talked to him… I should have known…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Tavern41_Cynical_Default=Bowl of soup? That's the worst password I've ever heard!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple1_Lowlife_Default=Hey, Nel. So, I'm supposed to ask you for, uh…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple2_Nel_NPC=A bowl of soup?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple3_Lowlife_Default=You knew?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple4_Nel_NPC=Of course! Misaye sees all!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple5_Lowlife_Default=And you didn't tell me because…?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple6_Nel_NPC=This was more fun!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple7_Lowlife_Default=For you and Misaye, I'm sure.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple8_Lowlife_Default=Well, I won't be a grouch about it.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple9_Nel_NPC=Aww! Misaye loves to tease a grouch!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple10_Nel_NPC=Ask properly!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple11_Lowlife_Default=Really?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple12_Nel_NPC=Rules are rules!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple13_Lowlife_Default=Rules - you? Oh, wait - only when it's fun, right?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple14_Nel_NPC=You're learning!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple15_Lowlife_Default=All right, then. chaplain Nel - may I please have a bowl of soup?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple16_Nel_NPC=Of course! It's in that chest.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple17_Lowlife_Default=This locked chest? I should have known.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple18_Lowlife_Default=Got it!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple19_Lowlife_Default=I can't get it…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple20_Nel_NPC=Make a donation to Misaye for luck?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple21_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=<i>Give 1 gold piece</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=Refuse
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_Lowlife_Default=Take it, you crook.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple23_Lowlife_Default=I don't think so.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple24_Nel_NPC=Your coin made Misaye smile!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple25_Nel_NPC=Try again, Misaye will help, this time.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple26_Lowlife_Default=Still nothing!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple27_Nel_NPC=Maybe you need to be more generous!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple28_Nel_NPC=You probably used the wrong number…
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple29_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=<i>Give 5 gold pieces</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=Refuse
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple30_Nel_NPC=Fine. Let's hope your skills are up to it.
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple31_Nel_NPC=Have you trained in your skills since the last time?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple32_Nel_NPC=You're welcome. Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceG_WRITTEN=<i>Give 200 gold pieces</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceF_WRITTEN=<i>Give 100 gold pieces</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceE_WRITTEN=<i>Give 50 gold pieces</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceD_WRITTEN=<i>Give 20 gold pieces</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest_Temple22_ChoiceC_WRITTEN=<i>Give 10 gold pieces</i>
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest90_Scavengers2_Bagmordah_NPC=You're back! Did you get it?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest91_Scavengers2_Lowlife_Default=Here! And you mentioned a reward?
Narration/&Optional_Lowlife_Quest92_Scavengers2_Bagmordah_NPC=Beside my undying gratitude? All right. Here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest1_Lawkeeper_Default=Hey, shorty! You in the army?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest2_Stig_NPC=Don't call me that! I'm a Royal Guard, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest3_Lawkeeper_Default=You… really? The Princess, and all?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest4_Stig_NPC=Yeah. Those your friends?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest5_Friendly_Default=We are. How do you know each other?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest6_Stig_NPC=You didn't tell them?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest7_Stig_NPC=We were in the City Guard together.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest8_Lawkeeper_Default=And we both… upgraded.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest9_Stig_NPC=Anyway, I need help.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest10_Stig_NPC=I think someone's rotten in the Guard.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest11_Selfpres_Default=That's reassuring…
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest12_Pragmatic_Default=We have important things to do, mind you.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest13_Lawkeeper_Default=Hey, Stig is my friend!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest14_Pragmatic_Default=Fine.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest15_Stig_NPC=I need to go. Meet me at the Palace entrance when you… have time.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest16_Lawkeeper_Default=Hey, Stig!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest17_Stig_NPC=Hey, there. You ready?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest18_Lawkeeper_Default=Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest21_Any=So, what can we do to help?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest22_Stig_NPC=I have four suspects. Here are their names and posts.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest23_Stig_NPC=It won't be easy.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest24_Stig_NPC=They mustn't know I suspect them.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest25_Lawkeeper_Default=We'll check them out - no problem!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest26_Stig_NPC=Strike true!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge27_Cynical_Default=All right. Stig says he should be leaving soon.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge28_Lawful_Default=There he goes. Let him get a head start.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge29_Lawful_Default=…let's find a spot with a good view and wait for the night.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge30_Cynical_Default=Now that's a conspiracy!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge31_Cynical_Default=There might be an angry husband.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge32_Cynical_Default=It might be worth an arrest.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_HighBridge33_Lawkeeper_Default=Shut up!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance34_Friendly_Default=Clear skies!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance35_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC=I know you - you're the Sorak killers!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance36_Lawkeeper_Default=Anything you want to share… off the books?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance37_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC=What?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance38_Lawkeeper_Default=A little business of yours.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance39_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC=Oh. Sure.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance40_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC=Not here, though. Meet me at the promontory, tonight.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance41_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC=Quiet place. I like it.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance42_Lawkeeper_Default=So, what have you got?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance43_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC=In a rush, eh? All right. Here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance44_Lawkeeper_Default=Booze? Really?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance45_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC=Hey, you asked for it!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance46_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC=My boss would kill me for selling New Empire liquor.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance47_Lawkeeper_Default=This isn't illegal?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance48_SnowAllianceGuard_NPC=Of course not! Just… you know… Imperial. Slaver stuff.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_SnowAlliance49_Lawkeeper_Default=Never mind. Our mistake. Sorry to waste your time.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk50_Drunk_NPC=This is my seat!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk51_Drunk_NPC=I always sit here!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk52_Drunk_NPC=You're a strange bunch, you know that?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk53_Drunk_NPC=Even stranger than that Arwin Merton.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk54_Drunk_NPC=Are you gonna say something?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk55_Drunk_NPC=Knew it. You Council pawns are fake.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk56_Drunk_NPC=Killed Soraks? Right. And I've got a dragon in my pocket.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk57_Drunk_NPC=Now you're pissing me off.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk58_Lawkeeper_Default=Well, I'm not sure he's smart enough to be corrupt.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk59_Any_Default=Think he can work? He can barely stand!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk60_Any_Default=Let's go and see, then.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk61_Lawkeeper_Default=What is he doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk62_Partner_Default=Hijacking a crate from a delivery.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk63_Lawkeeper_Default=Let's see what's in it.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk64_Lawkeeper_Default=Flowers?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk65_Herbalism_Default=Angry Violets, hundreds of them.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk66_Drunk_NPC=Hey! What are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk67_Persuasion_WRITTEN=We just want a share of the loot.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk68_Intimidation_WRITTEN=You're clearly a thief - admit it!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk69_Deception_WRITTEN=We're investigating you for Captain Ironshell.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk70_Default_WRITTEN=The question is, what are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk71_Persuasion_CHOICE=We got you. Let us take some of these and we'll keep quiet.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk72_Drunk_FAIL=You Council people really think you can do whatever you like, don't you?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk73_Intimidation_CHOICE=We caught you red-handed. Just confess.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk74_Intimidation_FAIL=You're a bunch of idiots, I'll confess that.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk75_Deception_FAIL=Captain Ironshell asked us to investigate you.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk76_Drunk_FAIL=Oh yeah? That's a good one. She asked me to bring this to the Palace.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk77_Default_FAIL=The question is, what are you doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk78_Drunk_FAIL=My job. What did you think I was doing?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk79_Lawkeeper_Default=Why did you pick this crate out of the delivery?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk80_Drunk_NPC=Oh, this one?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk81_Drunk_NPC=Let me think.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk82_Drunk_NPC=This is for her Royal Highness, going through Captain Ironshell directly.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk83_Drunk_NPC=I'm sure the Princess will appreciate you rummaging through her personal stuff.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk84_Drunk_NPC=As everyone knows, everything for her personal use is tax free.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk85_Cynical_Default=I knew that.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk86_Drunk_NPC=Ask the Captain. Go right ahead.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Drunk87_Lawkeeper_Default=That won't be necessary. Carry on.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple88_TempleGuard_NPC=Rodric isn't here.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple89_TempleGuard_NPC=Rodric? He's on an errand.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple90_Any_Default=Nothing. We're wasting our time.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple91_Lawkeeper_Default=This Rodric, though - where is he?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple92_Any_Default=Let's check again.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple93_Lawkeeper_Default=You're Rodric?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple94_Alrin_NPC=Who's asking?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_Temple95_Lawkeeper_Default=We're Council deputies…
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End96_Any_Default=What was that?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End97_Any_Default=He's not just a Guard, that's for sure!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End98_Arcana_Default=That's a shadowcaster trick! He can't be far!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End99_Lawkeeper_Default=Look for tracks.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End100_Lawkeeper_Default=A secret tunnel? We're on to something here!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End101_Lawkeeper_Default=What have you found?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End102_Any_Default=Enough to implicate Rodric and his friends.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End103_Any_Default=They were smuggling goods in and out of the Temple Quarter.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End104_Lawkeeper_Default=Hey, Stig!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End105_Stig_NPC=I heard what happened! Rodric's a shadowcaster?
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End106_Lawkeeper_Default=Rodric's a corpse. He attacked us with a bunch of his friends.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End107_Lawkeeper_Default=Take this. You can follow up and shut down his network.
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End108_Stig_NPC=Fantastic! Thanks for the help, my friends!
Narration/&Optional_Lawkeeper_Quest_End109_Lawkeeper_Default=Stay in the light, Stig!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start1_Mayor_NPC=A moment, if you please, deputy!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start2_Aristocrat_Default=Lady Bright-Spark? How may we help you?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start3_Mayor_NPC=You could start by not calling me that.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start4_Aristocrat_Default=As you wish.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start5_Mayor_NPC=I have a messy business on my desk, and your name's on it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start6_Aristocrat_Default=My name?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start7_Mayor_NPC=It's an inheritance…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start8_Mayor_NPC=…with a bunch of people contesting the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start9_Aristocrat_Default=What? Who died?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start10_Mayor_NPC=The honorable Joan Tannerson.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start11_Aristocrat_Default=Oh. I see.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start12_Anyother_Default=Family?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start13_Aristocrat_Default=She was… my mentor. A renowned lawyer.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start14_Cynical_Default=You're a lawyer?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start15_Aristocrat_Default=Do I look like a lawyer?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start16_Cynical_Default=Wouldn't put it past you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start17_Aristocrat_Default=What is the mess, exactly?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start18_Mayor_NPC=Tannerson left you everything, according to the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start19_Mayor_NPC=Her children aren't happy, and the notary is very… annoying.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start20_Mayor_NPC=So please - do something. Anything. Just make them stop harassing me.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start21_Mayor_NPC=I have more important things to deal with.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start22_Aristocrat_Default=Perhaps I should talk to the children first.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start23_Mayor_NPC=Do whatever you want, as long as it shuts this notary up!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start24_Aristocrat_Default=Right. Thank you… my lady.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Start25_Mayor_NPC=Tsss…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew11_Aristocrat_Default=Drew! How are you holding up?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew12_Drew_NPC=Look - it's the famous heir. Should I bow?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew13_Aristocrat_Default=Listen, I have no idea…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew14_Drew_NPC=Of course! It's just bad luck that you got everything.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew15_Aristocrat_Default=Can we talk?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew16_Drew_NPC=Talk to my lawyer. Oh, wait…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew17_Violent_Default=He needs a smack in the mouth.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew18_Aristocrat_Default=He's… grieving.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Drew19_Violent_Default=I'll give him something to grieve over.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria11_Aristocrat_Default=Lyria, I'm so very sorry for your loss.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria12_Lyria_NPC=Oh - you're the… well… I knew she liked you, but…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria13_Aristocrat_Default=Frankly, this all seems like a prank.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria14_Lyria_NPC=Right? That's what I told the notary.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria15_Lyria_NPC=Goodbye.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Lyria16_Lowlife_Default=These people!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria11_Aristocrat_Default=Adria! How are you?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria12_Adria_NPC=Well, sad, of course. You?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria13_Aristocrat_Default=Thanks for asking. A bit down, of course.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria14_Aristocrat_Default=She taught me so much.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria15_Adria_NPC=I know. She was proud of you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria16_Aristocrat_Default=Thank you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria17_Aristocrat_Default=Listen - this will. It bothers me…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria18_Aristocrat_Default=…I really don't want to quarrel with you and your siblings.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria19_Adria_NPC=I'm afraid you won't have a choice.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria110_Adria_NPC=Lyria is a lying bitch, and Drew is a tactless jerk.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria111_Aristocrat_Default=What would you do with the inheritance?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria112_Adria_NPC=Me? Share it with the two other sharks, just to stay alive.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Adria113_Aristocrat_Default=Fair enough.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack1_Anyother_Default=They're not bandits.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack2_Aristocrat_Default=No. More like hired assassins.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack3_Anyother_Default=You know what this means.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Attack4_Aristocrat_Default=Stay alert. The notary's mansion might not be safe either.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending1_Cynical_Default=Oh, look - they're all here.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending2_Lyria_NPC=So you left Caer Cyflen without a word.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending3_Drew_NPC=How rude.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending4_Aristocrat_Default=Can we take this inside?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending5_Lyria_NPC=Just tell us what you decided and stop wasting our time.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending6_Lyria_NPC=At least share the inheritance. I need it for my research.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending7_Lyria_Default=The Circle of Danantar will reward you.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending8_Drew_NPC=Yeah, right. That inheritance will give me enough to get married…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending9_Drew_Default=My father-in-law to be is very influential in the Tower of Knowledge, you know.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending10_Aristocrat_Default=Adria?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending11_Adria_NPC=I respect Mother's decision. It's all yours.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending12_Drew_NPC=What? Did the Soraks replace you or something?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending13_Lyria_NPC=Even from you, Drew, that's low.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending14_Notary_NPC=Ah, so you are all here.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending15_Notary_NPC=Why didn't you come in?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending16_Aristocrat_Default=You're right. Let's finish this.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending17_WRITTEN_ChoiceA=The inheritance is mine.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending18_WRITTEN_ChoiceB=<i>Choose an heir from among the children.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending19_WRITTEN_ChoiceC=<i>Split the inheritance four ways.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending20_WRITTEN_ChoiceD=<i>Split the inheritance between the children.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending21_Aristocrat_ChoiceA=Your mother left me everything. Her will should be respected.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending22_Aristocrat_ChoiceC=We'll split the inheritance between the four of us.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending23_Aristocrat_ChoiceD=You should each get a third of the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending24_WRITTEN_ChoiceE=<i>Give the inheritance to Lyria.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending25_WRITTEN_ChoiceF=<i>Give the inheritance to Drew.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending26_WRITTEN_ChoiceG=<i>Give the inheritance to Adria.</i>
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending27_Aristocrat_ChoiceE=I'll give Lyria the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending28_Aristocrat_ChoiceF=I'll give Drew the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending29_Aristocrat_ChoiceG=I'll give Adria the inheritance.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending30_Lyria_NPC=Excellent!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending31_Drew_NPC=By all the gods…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending32_Drew_NPC=Yes!
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending33_Lyria_NPC=What? Why?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending34_Adria_NPC=Thank you! I'll share with you both, you know it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending35_Notary_NPC=Well, that's settled, then.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending36_Notary_NPC=I will magically seal the will.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending37_Notary_NPC=I'm sorry, the law forbids it.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending38_Notary_NPC=You can share it after you accept it, but there must be one single heir.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending39_Notary_NPC=You know… paperwork.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending40_Adria_NPC=Fine… I thought I had cracked you…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending41_Aristocrat_Default=What?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending42_Adria_Default=Sorry, sir, this will have to be done outside the law, I'm afraid.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending43_Anyother_Default=She killed all her siblings?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending44_Cynical_Default=Maybe she was a Sorak agent?
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending45_Aristocrat_Default=They were all my childhood friends…
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending46_Cynical_Default=Oh, yes. Sorry.
Narration/&Optional_Aristocrat_Quest_Ending47_Aristocrat_Default=It's over. Let's go.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_01_Default_Default=Who's this? Seems to like wolves.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_02_Insight_10_Success=Could be a ranger. Could be a werewolf. Could be something else.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_03_Kill-CHOICE=Let's kill them!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_04_Leave_CHOICE=Let's get out of here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_05_Speak_CHOICE=Let's talk to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_06_Kill_Default=Just someone else to kill. No one out here is friendly, remember?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_07_Friendly_Default=Maybe he knows something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_08_Pragmatic_Default=Out here, there's no such thing as "can't hurt."
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_09_Pragmatic_Default=Didn't your mother tell you never to talk to strangers?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_10_Leave_Default=We're not here to make friends, and we have enough enemies. Let's just go!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_11_Speak_Default=He might know something about the castle. It can't hurt to ask.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_12_Persuade_CHOICE=Hello!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_13_Intimidate_CHOICE=Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_14_Friendly_Default=Hello! We come in peace! Can we talk to you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_15_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success=Talk, then. And stay where you are. I can hear you well enough from here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_16_Persuade_Default_20_Success=We're… interested in the castle. Can you tell us anything about it?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_17_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Success=Not much. What do you want to know?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_18_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure=You come in peace, do you? Then you're the only peaceful things here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_19_Talbut_NPC_Persuasion_20_Failure=Go in peace, before I get tired of being peaceful.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_20_Intimidate_Default=Hey, you! Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_21_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success=I can hear you fine from here. What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_22_Intimidate_Default_20_Success=What do you know about that castle over there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_23_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Success=What do you want to know?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_24_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure=Ha! Aren't you tough?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_25_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure=Believe me, you don't want me coming over there.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_26_Talbut_NPC_Intimidation_20_Failure=Now get lost, before I change my mind!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_27_Default_CHOICE=Who lives there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_28_Fighter_CHOICE=How strong is the garrison?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_29_Authority_CHOICE=Who is its ruler?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_30_Default_Default=Who lives there? What can you tell us about them?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_31_Talbut_NPC=I deal with the guard captain. Name's Adam the Twelfth. Undead now.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_32_Talbut_NPC=He lets us hunt here and we tell him who comes and goes.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_33_Default_Default=Sounds like a good arrangement. So you've never been inside the castle?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_34_Talbut_NPC=No.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_35_Default_Default=And there's no one else outside the castle?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_36_Default_Default=Just a ghost - a dwarf. Doesn't seem dangerous.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_37_Fighter_Default=What's the garrison like? Strong? Weak? Monsters?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_38_Talbut_NPC=The captain's a wraith, or something similar. The guard's mostly skeletons.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39_Fighter_Default=Mostly?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_40_Talbut_NPC=That's what I've seen from outside. Never been inside.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Authority_Default=Who rules the castle? Or should I rather ask what?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Talbut_NPC=Name's Mardracht. Probably undead, but I never met him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Authority_Default=Probably undead? Why do you say that?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Talbut_NPC=Undead or a necromancer, is my guess. Everyone I've seen there is undead.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_WRITTEN_Exit=Thanks, that's all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_45_Goodbye_Default=Many thanks for the information, uh - I didn't catch your name?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_46_Talbut_NPC=Talbut.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_01_Starter_Normal=Look! What's that?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_02_Partner_Normal=Some kind of incorporeal being - undead, most likely.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_03_Starter_Normal=Look! That must be the dwarf ghost we heard about!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_04_Kill-CHOICE=Let's destroy it!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_05_Leave_CHOICE=Let's keep moving.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_06_Speak_CHOICE=Let's talk to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_07_Kill_Default=The undead are an affront to nature! They must be destroyed!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_08_Leave_Default=An unnecessary fight is an unnecessary risk. Let's move on.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_09_Speak_Default=I'll take information where I can get it - even from a ghost.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_10_Persuade_CHOICE=We have questions.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_11_Intimidate_CHOICE=Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_12_Starter_Normal=Hello! Could we ask you some questions?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_13_Starter_Normal=Hello! Are you the Antiquarian we've heard about?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_14_Angbi_NPC=Hello! I am Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians. Or at least, I used to be.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Intimidate=Hey, you - ghost! Get over here!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_15_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success=All right. There's no need to be rude. What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_16_Angbi_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure=What are you going to do - kill me? Just - leave me alone.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_17_Starter_Default=What can you tell us about the castle? Who lives there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_18_Angbi_NPC=Two women. A high elf, but living, and quite old. She is a necromancer of some sort.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_19_Starter_Default=And the other?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_20_Angbi_NPC=Once human, but definitely undead now. A Defiler, I think…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_21_Angbi_NPC=…and she had a gang of ghouls with her. Horrid beasts. I avoided them.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_22_Starter_Default=Is there anyone else?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest02_23_Angbi_NPC=There's a garrison - skeletons, mostly. I avoided them, too.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_01_NPC_Angbi=Actually, I was hoping to ask you a greater favor.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_02_Starter_Default=How can we help you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_03_NPC_Angbi=I was killed in this cemetery. My bones are here somewhere.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_04_Partner_Default=And you'd like us to take them home for burial, so you can find peace.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_05_NPC_Angbi=Well, yes - but they got a little scattered. The wolves, you see.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_06_Joker_Normal=Now, that's just rude.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_07_NPC_Angbi=As far as I can… feel, they are in three separate places.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_08_Joker_Normal=Well, that's just you all over!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_09_Helpful_Normal=You can rely on us.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_10_NPC_Angbi=It's not just about burial, although of course I'd be grateful for that, too.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_11_NPC_Angbi=Since I was killed, I've carried on studying this necropolis…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_12_NPC_Angbi=…but I can't touch material things, including pens - so I haven't been able to update my journal.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_13_Joker_Normal=Now, that's what I call work ethic.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_14_NPC_Angbi=And since my spirit is bound to my mortal remains…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_15_NPC_Angbi=…I can't return to Caer Cyflen to report in person.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_16_NPC_Angbi=But if you take my bones back, perhaps my spirit could travel with them…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_17_NPC_Angbi=…and the knowledge I've recovered won't be lost.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Helpful_Formal=We will do as you ask, Angbi Kramsson of the Antiquarians!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_01_Starter_Default=Delegate Summer! May we speak with you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_02_NPC_Halman=Yes - what is it?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_03_Starter_Default=We have something for you.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_04_NPC_Angbi=Or rather, someONE.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_05_NPC_Halman=Angbi? Angbi Kramsson? Is that you?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_06_NPC_Angbi=It is. Or was. Anyway, I'm here.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_07_NPC_Angbi=These kind deputies brought my bones back, and my spirit came with them.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_08_NPC_Halman=Thank you, deputies. I am in your debt, and so is the Guild of Antiquarians.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_09_NPC_Halman=On behalf of the Guild, let me offer you something for your trouble.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_10_NPC_Halman=I will make sure you go home to your family for burial, Angbi.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_11_NPC_Angbi=Thank you, Halman. But before you do, I'd like to make my report.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_12_NPC_Halman=Your report?
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_13_NPC_Angbi=One advantage of being a ghost is the ability to walk through walls, you see…
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_14_NPC_Angbi=…so after my death, I was able to conduct a very thorough survey of an Imperial necropolis.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_15_NPC_Angbi=I couldn't lift a pen to write it down, so I'll report in person. If that's acceptable.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_16_NPC_Halman=Well… I… let me take you to the Chancellor. She will want to know.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_17_NPC_Angbi=Capital! We're distant cousins, you know.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest102_18_NPC_Halman=No, I didn't.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_01_Caerellian_NPC=You there! Stop! Don't move!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_02_Caerellian_NPC=Who are you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_LEAVE_CHOICE=We should leave.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_KILL_CHOICE=We should attack.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_PERSUADE_CHOICE=We should negotiate.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_06_DECEIVE_CHOICE=We should trick him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_07_Leave_Default=He's not the listening type, I can tell. We should leave and try another approach.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_08_Kill_Default=It's just a few skeletons. Let's get 'em!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_09_Deceive_Default=Look, I can tell you're a very important and, ah…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_10_Persuade_Default=Will you at least hear us before we go?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_11_Deceiver_Normal=…long-serving officer, so I won't waste your time…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_12_Deceiver_Normal=…the fact is, I'm with the Imperial intelligence service.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_13_Deceiver_Normal=The others don't know, but our mission has been ordered by the Emperor himself.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_14_Deceiver_Normal=Our orders are to meet with your master and ask him certain questions. Nothing more than that.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_15_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Success=It's not up to me. You'll have to deal with the others in the keep.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure=I may be dead, but I'm not stupid.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_16_Caerellian_NPC_Deception_25_Failure2=The Empire fell a thousand years ago. There is no Emperor.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_17_Caerellian_NPC=Take your lies and get out!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_18_Persuader_Normal=We understand that your master values his privacy, and we respect that.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_19_Starter_Normal=You may not have heard of the Legacy Council, but…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_20_Caerellian_NPC=I know the name. That dwarf - Antiquarian, or whatever he calls himself - they sent him too.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_21_Caerellian_NPC=I'll tell you what I told him: your Council has no authority here, and the master does not receive visitors!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_22_Caerellian_NPC=I don't know how you got in, but either you leave peacefully, or…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_23_Persuader_Normal=We know that your master is very learned and powerful. We just want to ask him about something, that's all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_25_Caerellian_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure=You want to steal from him, more like!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_26_Persuader_Normal=No - I swear…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_01_Lizzaria_NPC=Who are you? What do you want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_02_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE=To see you beg for your life
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_03_KILL_CHOICE=To destroy you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_04_PERSUADE_CHOICE=To meet your master.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest03_05_DECEIVE_CHOICE=To make a deal.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06_Intimidate_Default=Give me one good reason why we shouldn't kill you right here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_07_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success=Tell me what you want, and I'll think about it.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_08_Intimidator_Normal=What we want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_09_Lizzaria_NPC=I know this place. You don't. Let's trade.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_10_Intimidator_Normal=All right - talk.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_11_Lizzaria_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure=Who do you think you're dealing with?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC=That tough act may impress the girls back home…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_17_Lizzaria_NPC2=…but I've seen scarier things in the mirror.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_18_Kill_Default=You can never trust a necromancer. We should just kill them all.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_19_Persuader_Normal=We need to consult your master about an ancient magical artifact.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_20_Persuader_Normal=All we need is to talk to him, and then we'll be on our way and you'll never see us again.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success=I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_21_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2=There are some things you should know.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_22_Persuader_Normal=What things?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_23_Lizzaria_NPC_Persuasion_25_Falure=You must think I'm a complete idiot.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_24_Lizzaria_NPC=Kill them all!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_25_Deceiver_Normal=Look, whatever you do in the privacy of your own castle is your own business…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_26_Deceiver_Normal=…as long as you don't do it to us, of course.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal=But the thing is, we've come a very long way…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_27_Deceiver_Normal2=…and it's vitally important that we speak to Master Mardracht.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_28_Lizzaria_NPC=Really?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_29_Deceiver_Normal=Oh, yes - it's a matter of life and - well, you know what I mean.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_30_Lizzaria_NPC=What's it about?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal=Ah - I'm sorry. Really. But our orders are to speak only to him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_31_Deceiver_Normal2=They come from the very highest level.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC=I can't get you in to see the master, but I can help.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_32_Lizzaria_NPC2=There are some things you should know.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC=Well, in that case, go straight upstairs and ask for Aksha.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_34_Lizzaria_NPC2=If anyone can persuade the master, she can.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_35_Lizzaria_NPC=If you want to talk to Mardracht, you'll have to get past Aksha.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_36_Starter_Normal=Who's Aksha?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37_Lizzaria_NPC=A defiler. She lives upstairs.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_38_Lizzaria_NPC=She turned up a few years ago, seemed interested in the work, offered to help out…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_39_Lizzaria_NPC=…and suddenly she'd installed herself upstairs and no one talked to the master except through her.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_40_Lizzaria_NPC=I haven't seen Mardracht face to face since she got here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC=She says she takes messages to him, and she brings messages back…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_41_Lizzaria_NPC2=…but they don't sound like him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC=I know - knew him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC2=He was my mentor, my teacher.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_42_Lizzaria_NPC3=She's holding him prisoner, I'm certain.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_43_Starter_Normal=So we'll have to go through her?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC=If you can. She's got a pack of ghouls…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Lizzaria_NPC2=…and those defiler powers of hers are no joke, either.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC=We've tried using force before, more than once…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Lizzaria_NPC2=…but I got sick of losing people.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal=Thanks for the warning.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_46_Starter_Normal2=Now, suppose we do manage to reach Master Mardracht…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_47_Starter_Normal=…what's the best way to approach him?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC=Hard to say.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC2=The Cataclysm hit him hard…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_48_Lizzaria_NPC3=…and then Aksha - who knows what she's done to him?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_49_Lizzaria_NPC=The stairs will take you to her apartments. Good luck getting past her.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_01_Aksha_NPC=Well. Lizzaria's taste in minions seems to be improving.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_02_Starter=We're no one's minions, lady.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_03_Aksha_NPC=You defeated her, then? I'm almost impressed.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_04_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE=Step away!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_05_KILL_CHOICE=We'll destroy you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_06_PERSUADE_CHOICE=We just want to talk to Mardracht.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_07_DECEIVE_CHOICE=We can offer you blood.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate_Defult=We need to speak to your master.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_08_Intimidate2_Defult=You can get out of our way or try to stop us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_09_Deceive_Default=Let's trade. If you help us, we can help you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default=We ask a simple boon:
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_10_Persuade_Default2=An audience with Master Mardracht, and safe passage out of the castle.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11_Kill_Default=We'll leave an impression on you, too - a deep and bloody one!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_12_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Success=I'm in a generous mood today. Go ahead - but don't expect to get any sense out of the old coward.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_13_Default_Default=What does that mean - getting sense out of him?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_14_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure=Kill them! Kill them all!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_15_Aksha_NPC=Trade? What do you have that I could possibly want?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal=(low voice) How about blood?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal2=Not mine, of course…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_16_Deceiver_Normal3=…but get me in to see Mardracht and the others are all yours.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_17_Aksha_NPC=You'd sell the lives of your companions to see one crazy old wizard?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_18_Deceiver_Normal=Crazy? What do you mean?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_19_Aksha_NPC_Intimidation_25_Failure=You must think I was born yesterday…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal=We believe your master knows about a powerful ancient artifact.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_20_Persuader_Normal2=We need his knowledge.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_21_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success=Hm. Your puny minds couldn't comprehend what he once knew.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_22_Aksha_NPC=Now, it's a good day if he knows who I am.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_23_Persuader_Normal=What do you mean?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_24_Aksha_NPC=You'll see.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_25_Aksha_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure=Let me think…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC=He's sealed his apartments off with powerful magic.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_26_Aksha_NPC2=Keeps raving about gods coming to get him.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_27_Aksha_NPC=The Minor Gate is the only way in.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_28_Default_Default=Minor Gate?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_29_Aksha_NPC=Yes. Over there.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_01_Mardracht_NPC=Who are you? How did you get in here?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_02_Default_Default=Master Mardracht?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_03_Mardracht_NPC=You know my name! How do you know my name?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_04_Default_Default=We represent the Legacy Council, Master - and we mean you no harm.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_05_Mardracht_NPC=No harm? No harm, they say - they always say that, always. They lie!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_06_Mardracht_NPC=Get out! I can still defend myself, you know!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_07_INTIMIDATE_CHOICE=Can't you see we're too strong?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_08_PERSUADE_CHOICE=We don't want to kill you.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_09_DECEIVE_CHOICE=We want to save Solasta.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default=We found you and we breached your defenses.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_10_Intimidate_Default2=Do you really want to test your power against ours?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default=You are right to fear us, and those who sent us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_11_Deceive_Default2=We are powerful - but you don't have to die.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default=All we ask is that you hear what we have to say.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_12_Persuade_Default2=After that, we'll leave you in peace if that's what you want.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_13_Mardracht_NP=If you are not here to kill me - then what?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal=I offer you the chance to buy your life.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_14_Intimidator_Normal2=Will you take it? Will you give up your gem?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_15_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Success=For my life? I…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_16_Mardracht_NPC_Intimidate_25_Failure=Lies! All lies! I know your gods and their treachery!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_17_Deceive_Default=The gods have commanded us to kill you…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_18_Mardracht_NPC=I knew it!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_19_Deceiver_Normal=…but we don't need to do that - if you'll help us.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_20_Deceiver_Normal=We must have the Gem of Necromancy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_21_Mardracht_NPC=The gem… ? But…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal=But without your gem, we can't remake the Crown.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_22_Deceiver_Normal2=Without the Crown, we can't defeat the gods.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_23_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Success=I… The gods? I don't… the Crown?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_24_Mardracht_NPC_Deception_25_Failure=You have the Crown? No!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC=I see through your lies! Your evil gods want its power to destroy me!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_25_Mardracht_NPC2=To destroy Solasta!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default=We are here to ask about the Crown of the Magister…
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_26_Persuade_Default2=…specifically, about the Gem of Necromancy.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_27_Mardracht_NPC=What? What do you know of the Crown? What are you plotting?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_28_Persuader_Normal=We're not plotting anything. We don't really know what's going on.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_29_Persuader_Normal=But the Crown found us, and it seems that it wants to be whole again.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success=But wait - the Crown is active?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_30_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Success2=And it chose you?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_31_Persuader_Normal=Well… Yes. We're not sure why.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_32_Mardracht_NPC=The very existence of Solasta must be threatened!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure=Give me the Crown!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_33_Mardracht_NPC_Persuasion_25_Failure2=This is no task for the likes of you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_34_Mardracht_NPC=I must find the other Masters! Give me the Crown!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_35_Persuader_Normal=But…?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_36_Mardracht_NPC=NOW!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_37_Mardracht_NPC=This is what you came for.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest06_38_Mardracht_NPC=Take it - and leave me alone!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle1_Any_Default=The gem's in the castle?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle2_Any_Default=Maybe. It's in that direction.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle3_Any_Default=That's a good-sized castle. A garrison of two dozen at least.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle4_Any_Default=There's a path to the right. Maybe we can find cover, and size the place up without being seen.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle5_Any_Default=We could just show our Legacy Council credentials.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle6_Any_Default=Assuming they're law-abiding folk who'll respect the Council…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_01_ViewCastle7_Any_Default=…Not too many of those around here, I'm guessing.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate1_Any_Default=We're not getting in that way.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate2_Any_Default=Could we climb up?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate3_Any_Default=It's too open. We'd be easy targets.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_02_CastleFrontGate4_Any_Default=We'll have to find another way.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs1_Any_Default=Remember the way we've come. I wouldn't want to get lost down here.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs2_Any_Default=Typical First Expansion architecture, with some embellishments…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs3_Any_Default=…probably used right up to the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs4_Any_Default=Great idea! Let's walk through the catacombs, talking loudly!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_03_Catacombs5_Any_Default=Everyone knows the undead are deaf!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry1_Any_Default=Another door.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry2_Any_Default=Oh, good. Just when I was thinking it would be too easy.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry3_Any_Default=Look at the top. What is that?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry4_Any_Default=Looks like a magical shield of some sort.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry5_Any_Default=Some sort? How many sorts are there?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry6_Any_Default=What we're looking for is up there.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry7_Any_Default=You're sure?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_04_AtKeepEntry8_Any_Default=It's obvious - the best loot gets the best protection.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well1_Any_Default=This could be our way in.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well2_Any_Default=Perfect. We climb down a wet, slippery, stone shaft…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well3_Any_Default=…into water that's who knows how deep…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_05_Well4_Any_Default=…and hope there's a way out. What could possibly go wrong?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain1_Any_Default=This drain could be a way in.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain2_Any_Default=Into what? The bathroom's one way, and the cesspool the other?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain3_Any_Default=Suppose we get down there and it's just six-inch pipes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_06_StormDrain4_Any_Default=Then we'll look for another way in. But let's try it first!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside1_Any_Default=That doesn't look right.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside2_Any_Default=It's a drain. What's wrong with that?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside3_Any_Default=Yes, but inside a building?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside4_Any_Default=Maybe the roof leaks.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside5_Any_Default=Maybe this was a stock shed. A drain can be handy for mucking out.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside6_Any_Default=That one's big enough for a cow to fall down. Doesn't make sense.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside7_Any_Default=Unless…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside8_Any_Default=I swear, if you say something smart…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside9_Any_Default=I never say anything that's not. But think about it:
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside10_Any_Default=It's big enough to climb down. It's hidden in a building. And it's close to both the walls and the keep.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_07_StormDrainInside11_Any_Default=Are you saying it's a secret entrance?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs1_Any_Default=The outside graves were likely for servants and guards.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs2_Any_Default=The mausoleum holds a few burials, but its main purpose is to hide this secret entrance.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs3_Any_Default=The most important graves are in the catacombs down below.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_08_EnterCatacombs4_Any_Default=And by "important," you mean "rich."
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter1_Any_Default=So - this is a Minor Gate?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter2_Any_Default=And we're sure it goes where the defiler woman said it goes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter3_Any_Default=Did you see any other way to get there?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter4_Any_Default=So we're just going to trust her?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter5_Any_Default=That looks like a Minor Gate.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter6_Any_Default=Where do you suppose it goes?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter7_Any_Default=To the Master's floor, hopefully.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter8_Any_Default=Or into the heart of a volcano or somewhere equally unpleasant.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter9_Any_Default=We've heard how paranoid this Master is.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter10_Any_Default=So - are we going?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_09_Teleporter11_Any_Default=Why don't you go first? If it's somewhere nice, you can come back and tell us.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd1_Any_Default=So that's it?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd2_Any_Default=Yes? I can feel its power. It's… incredible!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd3_Any_Default=Don't let it overwhelm you. Necromancy is dark magic.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd4_Any_Default=That's right. We should probably sell it. How much do you think a smallish palace costs these days?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd5_Any_Default=Stop it. You know we can't do that.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd6_Any_Default=We must get it back to the Council.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_10_QuestEnd7_Any_Default=Can't blame me for trying.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar1_Any_Default=Ugh. Teleporting feels weird.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar2_Any_Default=I wonder what this Mardracht is like?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar3_Any_Default=If he fought at the Rift, imagine the stories he has to tell!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_11_EnterSolar4_Any_Default=Dropping in unannounced on a paranoid recluse with untold magical powers. What could possibly go wrong?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones011_Any_Default=It's a book!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones012_Any_Default=You're amazing! Just one look, and you knew!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones013_Any_Default=That's the sigil of the Antiquarians on the cover!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones014_Any_Default=It's in the common tongue: "The Journal of Angbi Kramsson."
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones015_Any_Default=Those must be his bones here.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones016_Any_Default=I bet the Antiquarians would like to have this.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_12_Angbisbones017_Any_Default=That was the ghost we met earlier!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText011_Any_Default=What's this?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText012_Any_Default=Going out on a limb, here - but I *think* it's a piece of parchment.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText013_Any_Default=You're not as funny as you think you are.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText014_Any_Default=It's high elven. Looks like notes for some kind of experiment.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_13_NecroText015_Any_Default=Like, for example, doing unspeakable magical things to dead bodies?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText021_Any_Default=What's this?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText022_Any_Default=It's a journal. Look - dates here, and entries there.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText023_Any_Default=What language is this?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText024_Any_Default=Draconic. They say it's older than high elven.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText025_Any_Default=Hm. Some scholars use obscure languages to prevent others stealing their research.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText026_Any_Default=Well, everyone said he was paranoid.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText027_Any_Default=Or…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText028_Any_Default=What? He's a dragon? How would that work?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText029_Any_Default=The most powerful dragons can take any form they choose. Why not an elf?
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_14_NecroText0210_Any_Default=That's pretty far-fetched. He probably just learned draconic.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil1_Any_Default=That looks weird.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil2_Any_Default=It's similar to some magical wards I've seen, but…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil3_Any_Default=Don't touch it! Don't go near it! Don't even look at it!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil4_Any_Default=It hasn't done anything yet.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil5_Any_Default=It doesn't work? I wonder…
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil6_Any_Default=Don't. Just don't.
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil7_Any_Default=Perhaps he made a *spelling* mistake!
Narration/&Necromancy_Observable_15_WeirdSigil8_Any_Default=I hate you.

Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_2_Pragmatism_Default=Better be sure!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_3_Kythaela_NPC=Who art thou?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_4_AcademicOrElse_Default=Old elvish! We are friends, my lady!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_5_Kythaela_NPC=The Master sent you?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_6_Any_Default=Which Master?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_7_Kythaela_NPC=How dare you!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_8_Pragmatism_Default=Dare what? Come outside and look around!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_9_Kythaela_NPC=But it's… impossible!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_10_Kythaela_NPC=Where am I?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_11_Pragmatism_Slang=It's called the Badlands!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_12_Kythaela_NPC=No! I was in the Aer-Elai, the heart of the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_13_Kythaela_NPC=I must find the Master!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_14_Kythaela_NPC=Kythaela, my name is the shield…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_15_Kythaela_NPC=…no, my name is Kythaela of the shield…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_16_Kythaela_NPC=…whatever this shield might be.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_17_Choice1_WRITTEN=Which Master?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_18_Choice2_WRITTEN=Aer-Elai?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_19_Choice3_WRITTEN=A shield?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_20_Choice1_Spoken=Which Master are you talking about?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_21_Choice2_Spoken=Aer-Elai? The heart of the Empire?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_22_Choice3_Spoken=What is this shield you're talking about?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_23_Kythaela_NPC=The Master of… I can't remember.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_24_Kythaela_NPC=Yes, this tower was in the Aer-Elai, a haven of peace!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_25_Kythaela_NPC=The shield is the master, and the master is the shield!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_26_Kythaela_NPC=But tell me - what happened?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_27_Any_Default=A thousand years ago, the Cataclysm ravaged the Empire.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_28_Kythaela_NPC=Cataclysm?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_29_Helpfulness_Default=My lady, what is the last thing you remember?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_30_Kythaela_NPC=I don't remember any Cataclysm… I remember… a large room…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_31_Kythaela_NPC=…people speaking about a rift, a great threat to the Empire…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_32_Kythaela_NPC=…strange creatures with strange powers…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_33_Choice_Academic_WRITTEN=You mean THE Rift?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_34_Choice_Academic_Spoken=A rift? Do you mean THE rift?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_35_Kythaela_NPC=Are there more than one?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_36_Choice2_WRITTEN=Creatures? The Soraks?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_37_Choice2_Spoken=Strange creatures - yes, the Soraks, of course!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_38_Kythaela_NPC=No - they were called… humans…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_39_Kythaela_NPC=…strange beings, with magic that was not arcane.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_40_Kythaela_ifHumanAdventurer_NPC=They actually looked just like you!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_41_AcademicOrElse_Default=Fascinating! You witnessed a council of war! Can you recall anything else?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_42_Kythaela_NPC=One of the beings was wearing THIS Crown, scintillating with gems.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_43_Kythaela_NPC=They called him Magister, with the utmost respect!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_44_Kythaela_NPC=But you are not him. Where did you find this Crown?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_45_Choice1_WRITTEN=You met the Magister?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_46_Choice1_Spoken=The Magister? And this was his Crown?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_47_Choice2_WRITTEN=Scintillating?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_48_Choice2_Spoken=Scintillating with gems, you say?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_49_Choice3_WRITTEN=We found this Crown.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_50_Choice3_Spoken=We found this Crown in another part of the Badlands.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_51_Kythaela_NPC=He was wearing it, at least.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_52_Kythaela_NPC=Yes. The Crown was set with eight large gems.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_53_Kythaela_NPC=There are no Badlands!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_54_SellswordOrElse_Slang=Just look outside, lady! The Badlands are real!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_55_SellswordOrElse_Slang=And we had to fight Soraks to get the Crown!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_56_Kythaela_NPC=Soraks?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_57_Any_Default=The scourge of humanity.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_58_Any_Default=They ran the humans out of Tirmar…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_59_Any_Default=…and came here to finish the job!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_60_Kythaela_NPC=The humans weren't the enemy?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_61_Choice1_WRITTEN=They were refugees!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_62_Choice1_Spoken=No! They were refugees, fleeing the Soraks!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_63_Kythaela_NPC=Refugees? Eager to join the enlightenment of the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_64_AcademicOrElse_Default=Slavery isn't enlightenment! Those days died with the Empire!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_65_Kythaela_NPC=Silence, wretch! The Empire can't be dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_66_Any_NonHighElf_Rude=The Empire died with the Cataclysm! And even if it galls me to admit it…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_67_AcademicOrElse_Default=…it saved Solasta from a horrible fate!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_68_Choice2_WRITTEN=They warned the Empire.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_69_Choice2_Spoken=They convinced the Empire of the real threat.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_70_Kythaela_NPC=Those Soraks you mentioned?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_71_AcademicOrElse_Default=Yes! Dangerous, evil lizards, able to wield magic and to subvert minds!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_72_Kythaela_NPC=Weak human minds, for sure! And yet…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_73_AcademicOrElse_Default=And yet?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_74_Kythaela_NPC=Yet I recall an elf, a member of the household, trying to kill the Master…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_75_Choice3_WRITTEN=They joined forces.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_76_Choice3_Spoken=Their combined forces assaulted the Rift.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_77_Kythaela_NPC=There was mention of the Rift in the Aer-Elai.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_78_Any_Default=They managed to close it - but triggered the Cataclysm, ushering in a dark age!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_79_Kythaela_NPC=The dark age? Those Badlands you mentioned?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_80_Any_NPC=Yes! A thousand years of rebuilding after near extinction!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_81_Kythaela_NPC=It can't be! I still feel the Master!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_82_Kythaela_NPC=And I must find him!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_83_Any_Default=Times have changed since you last traveled in the Empire…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_84_Kythaela_NPC=Still, I feel the pull!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_85_Any_Default=The pull?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_86_Kythaela_NPC=Yes, a pull to get to the Copper Vale of Remembrance!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_87_Kythaela_NPC=Take me there at once and I shall name you favored servants!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_88_Crownbearer_Default=The Copper Vale of Remembrance?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_89_Kythaela_NPC=Yes - a fortress and place of rest for fallen heroes, roughly in this direction!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_90_Choice1_WRITTEN=The Vale of Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_91_Choice1_Spoken=Copper, fortress… hmmm - sounds like the Vale of Coparann!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_92_Choice2_WRITTEN=We're not your servants.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_93_Choice2_Spoken=We are no one's servants, favored or otherwise!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_94_Kythaela_NPC=Traveling companions, then!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_95_Kythaela_NPC=You can tell me of this Cataclysm on our journey!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_96_Choice3_WRITTEN=You seem sure we'll agree.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_97_Choice3_Spoken=You seem very certain that we'll go with you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_98_Kythaela_NPC=Of course - you wouldn't let a lady cross those Badlands alone, surely?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_1Galar_NPC=A timely arrival! Many thanks for your help!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_2_Pragmatism_Default=Clear skies, friend! What's going on here?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_3Galar_NPC=Those… fellows joined my caravan at Coparann…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_4Galar_NPC=…a couple of hours ago, this man stumbled on our path, almost dead…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_5Galar_NPC=…no healing could help him, so I put him in a tent…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_6Galar_NPC=…and I was about to send word to Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_7_Choice1Pragmatism_WRITTEN=Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_8_Choice1Pragmatism_Spoken=Coparann? That's where we're going!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_9Galar_NPC=Then perhaps you can do me a favor!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_10_CynicismOrElse_Default=A favor?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_11Galar_NPC=Of course I'll see that you're rewarded!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_12_Choice2Starter_WRITTEN=Almost dead?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_13_Choice2Starter_Spoken=Almost dead? Sick?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_14Galar_NPC=No, wounded! Deep wounds…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_15Galar_NPC=…ripped open, as if by sharp claws.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_16Galar_NPC=We found him near the road. It looked like he had crawled there.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_17_LawkeeperorElse_Default=Claw wounds? And no healing could help him?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_18Galar_NPC=That's right. The wounds were oozing.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_19Galar_NPC=It's a wonder he was still alive.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_20_Choice3Spy_WRITTEN=Send word?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_21_Choice3Spy_Spoken=Why send word?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_22Galar_NPC=Because this man was a corporal in the Coparann Watch.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_23_Starter_Default=You want us to take word of his death to Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_24Galar_NPC=Yes - take this note and his personal effects to Sergeant Nikannen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_25Galar_NPC=Have him countersign the note, then see my agent.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_26Galar_NPC=He is the owner of the general store.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_27Galar_NPC=Meanwhile, get some rest and share our camp!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_28Galar_NPC=We can even sell you some equipment!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_29_ArunFollower_Default=Let us share Arun's gifts!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Caravan_30_Any_Default=Many thanks for your hospitality!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_1_Guard_NPC=Halt! Do you seek entrance to our fair valley?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_2_Any_Default=Yes, we do!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_3_Guard_Npc=Then go see Sergeant Nikannen in the Guardhouse!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_4_Any_Default=Thank you! Clear skies!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_5_Guard_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_6_SgtNikannen_NPC=Good day! I am Sergeant Nikannen, officer of the day!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_7_SgtNikannen_NPC=What business brings you to Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_8_SellswordChoice1_WRITTEN=We found something.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_9_SellswordOrElse_Slang=Well, Sarge, we found something of yours on our way here!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_10_SgtNikannen_NPC=Of mine? What, exactly?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_11_AcademicChoice2_WRITTEN=We have something for you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_12_AcademicChoice2_Default=We were asked to give you certain items!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_13_SgtNikannen_NPC=Asked? By whom?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_14_SgtNikannen_NPC=And what items?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_15_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN=Galar sent us.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_16_SpyOrElse_Default=Master Galar Goldentongue asked us to see you - and to bring these…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_17_SellswordOrElse_Slang=Here they are, Sarge!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_18_SgtNikannen_NPC=The ring, the badge, the insignia…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_19_SgtNikannen_NPC=The man who wore those was of middling height…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_20_SgtNikannen_NPC=…broad shoulders, dark hair, and a broken nose. Am I right?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_21_SpyorElse_Default=Correct! You knew him, then?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_22_SgtNikannen_NPC=He broke his nose after an… exchange of views behind the barracks.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_23_SgtNikannen_NPC=Roald tried to headbutt his basic training instructor. That was me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_24_SgtNikannen_NPC=Now, tell me what happened to my good friend Roald!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_25_DiplomatOrElse_Default=First, please accept our sincere condolences!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_26_SgtNikannen_NPC=Thanks. Now tell me where, when, how - and who!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_27_DiplomatOrElse_Default=Two days ago.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_28_SpyOrElse_Default=It was at a small camp in some Manacalon ruins.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_29_SpyOrElse_Default=He was found almost dead by the caravan people.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_30_SpyOrElse_Default=They tried to heal him and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_31_SpyOrElse_Default=…some travelers in the caravan rushed in…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_32_SpyOrElse_Default=…to kill your friend and the guards Master Galar had posted!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_33_SgtNikannen_NPC=And no idea who those guys were?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_34_SellswordOrElse_Default=No, Sarge. They looked like common mercs to me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_35_SgtNikannen_Default=Did Roald say anything to you?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_37_SgtNikannen_NPC=Dire news. Listen - go and speak to the Ceannard. Tell him everything…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_SgtNikannen_NPC=…but leave Gromnir out of it for now.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_38_AcademicOrElse_WRITTEN=The Ceannard?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AcademicOrElse_Spoken=The Ceannard?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_39_AristocratOrElse_WRITTEN=Not the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_40_AristocratOrElse_Spoken=And why not the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_41_SgtNikannen_NPC=The Ceannard is the ruler of the Vale of Coparann.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_42_SgtNikannen_NPC=Talk to the Ceannard first and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_43_SgtNikannen_NPC=…perhaps we can discuss some more!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_44_AcademicOrElse_Default=And where is the Ceannard?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_45_Kythaela_NPC=But we need to talk to the Baron!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_46_SgtNikannen_NPC=You can find him at the Town Hall at this hour.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_47_SgtNikannen_NPC=Give him this note from me and tell him exactly what happened.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_48_SgtNikannen_NPC=You won't talk to him without my leave…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_49_SgtNikannen_NPC=Talk to the Ceannard first and then…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_50_SgtNikannen_NPC=Here - my signature on the letter from Galar…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_51_SgtNikannen_NPC=Take it to Master Warmhearth at the general store.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_52_SgtNikannen_NPC=And here's a note for the Ceannard!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_53_Any_Default=Stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_1_Ceannard_NPC=Clear skies! Joris Nikannen says you have an interesting story to tell!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_2_Any_Default=Clear skies to you, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_3_Any_Default=Well, it all began when we came upon this caravan…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_4_Ceannard_NPC=Go on.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_5_Ceannard_NPC=Hmm… military matters I usually leave in the more than competent hands of the Baron…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_6_Ceannard_NPC=…but Nikannen sent you to me.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_7_Ceannard_NPC=You see, he is a rarity in the Stonefist Mercenary company…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_8_Ceannard_NPC=…the one old hand who was born here.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_9_Ceannard_NPC=We have known each other almost all our lives!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_10_Ceannard_NPC=He is the reason Stonefist came to our aid during the orc invasion.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_11_Ceannard_NPC=And he sent you to me? That's odd! Why did you come to Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_12_Sellsword_WRITTEN=The Stonefist company?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_13_Sellsword_Spoken=The Stonefist mercenary company?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_14_Ceannard_NPC=Our military force, since they helped us repel the orc invasion!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_15_Academic_WRITTEN=Orc invasion?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_16_Academic_Spoken=An orc invasion?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_17_Ceannard_NPC=Happened about fifteen years ago. Several tribes got together…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_18_Ceannard_NPC=…whipped into a frenzy by a shaman.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_19_Ceannard_NPC=They hit us hard and opened a breach…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_20_Ceannard_NPC=…got a foothold in the outer works, and were about to hit the town.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_21_Ceannard_NPC=Then Gromnir hit them from behind, and they were between hammer and anvil!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_22_SpyOrElse_WRITTEN=Stonefist?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_23_SpyOrElse_Spoken=Who's Stonefist?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_24_Ceannard_NPC=Gromnir Stonefist, founder of the Stonefist mercenary company!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_Exit_WRITTEN=That doesn't answer my question.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_26_Highclass_Spoken=We are agents of the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_27_Highclass_Default=Our current mission is to escort Lady Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_28_Highclass_Default=Coparann was the seat of her family before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_29_Ceannard_NPC=And Lady Kythaela is on a nostalgia trip?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_30_Highclass_Default=Far from it! One of her ancestors left family heirlooms hidden in the fortress.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_31_Highclass_Default=Among those heirlooms, we hope to find clues about the next stage of our quest!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_32_Ceannard_NPC=Old elven nobility! I am sure I have never seen you before, Lady Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_33_Ceannard_NPC=So tell me something about Coparann that a newcomer or even a casual visitor couldn't know.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_34_Kythaela_NPC=In a side valley, there is an Imperial mausoleum of Lanaerach, home of the honored dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_35_AcademicorElse_WRITTEN=Mausoleum?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_36_AcademicorElse_Spoken=A place of remembrance?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_37_Kythaela_NPC=Yes, for the honored dead who fell in battle for the Empire.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_38_Ceannard_NPC=There is indeed an ancient Imperial mausoleum in a side valley, sealed off since the Fall of Manacalon!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_39_Ceannard_NPC=Not many know of it. Thank you, my lady - I am convinced.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_40_Sellsword_WRITTEN=Lanaerach?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_41_Sellsword_Spoken=What's Lanaerach?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_42_Ceannard_NPC=A very particular kind of marble - very precious!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_43_Ceannard_NPC=The traditional stone for the honored dead!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_44_Ceannard_NPC=As for the rest of you, you said you were sent by the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_45_Ceannard_NPC=We see a lot of Council agents on their way to the Badlands, and they bring a lot of rumors.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_46_Ceannard_NPC=So tell me - is there any truth to the rumor that the Soraks are back?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_47_AcademicorElse_Default=Yes! And they are as nasty as legends made them!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_48_Ceannard_NPC=Can they truly possess others?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_49_AcademicorElse_Default=Not possess, exactly…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_50_AcademicorElse_Default=…what they do is worse…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_51_AcademicorElse_Default=…if you believe the tales that the paladins of Einar recovered from their archives.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_52_Ceannard_NPC=Do me a favor: walk around our city, talk to the people…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_53_Ceannard_NPC=…then report your impressions to Sergeant Nikannen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_54_Ceannard_NPC=Not a word about what you told me, though.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_55_Insight15Success_Default=Do you believe the Soraks are in Coparann?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_56_Ceannard_NPC=I'll say no more for the time being!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_57_Ceannard_NPC=Walk the streets, then see Nikannen! Meanwhile, stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Ceannard01_58_Crownbearer_Default=Clear skies to you, Ceannard!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_1_Merchant1_NPC=It's rather silly, really. This young man…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_2_Merchant1_NPC=…he asked me for a specific design so he could propose…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_3_Merchant2_NPC=So? He probably gambled the money away!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_4_Merchant1_NPC=Not him! Straight arrow on the fast track to sergeant or higher! I asked around!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_5_Merchant2_NPC=So? Where is this paragon of yours?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Merchant01_6_Merchant1_NPC=Consigned to guard duty! A whole week! And that just on his return from patrol!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_1_YoungMaid_NPC=Sergeant, when can I see my Erik? He is due some liberty!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_2_Sergeant_NPC=Gal, I already told ya! He's assigned to guard duty!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_3_YoungMaid_NPC=A whole week of it - and that after two weeks on patrol!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_4_YoungMaid_NPC=No - he just doesn't want to see me anymore.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_5_Sergeant_NPC=Now, gal, don't you fret! It's not that at all.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_6_Sergeant_NPC=The Old Man has had his whole patrol on guard duty in the basement ever since they came back!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Seargent_7_Sergeant_NPC=Something's up - and whatever it is, it can't be good!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_1_Bartender_NPC=Mistress Mildred! The brewer wants to know when to bring the next delivery of ale.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_2_Bartender_NPC=He doesn't want it to go stale - he has his reputation to consider!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_3_Mildred_NPC=If only Stonefist had let his thirsty patrol out on leave as usual…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_4_Mildred_NPC=…but now, we've only the regulars and the ale's not moving too fast!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Mildred_5_Mildred_NPC=Take him two empty barrels and get two new ones. It's the best we can do right now!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_1_Patron1_NPC=Oh, the Ceannard's hopping mad!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_2_Patron2_NPC=Why's that?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_3_Patron1_NPC=A whole week he's been waiting - and still no meeting with the Baron!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_4_Patron2_NPC=That's weird. Usually they meet every day, at least!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Patrons_5_Patron2_NPC=Like an old couple, the two of them!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_1_Wilf_NPC=Well met! What can we do for you on this fine morning?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_2_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=We have a letter for you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_3_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=The Ceannard sent us.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceC_WRITTEN=Let's see your wares.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_4_ChoiceD_WRITTEN=We should go.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_5_ChoiceA_Spoken=Clear skies to you! Master Goldentongue sent this letter!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_6_Wilf_NPC=Of course, of course!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_7_Wilf_NPC=Yes - Master Goldentongue's instructions are quite clear!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_8_Wilf_NPC=Here is your money - and here's a receipt to sign!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_9_Wilf_NPC=Would you be interested in sampling our wares?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_10_Any_Default=What do you sell?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_11_Wilf_NPC=A pleasure doing business with you! Stay in the light!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_12_Any_Normal=The Ceannard sent us to talk to you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_13_Any_Normal=Anything unusual in recent days?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_14_Wilf_NPC=The Baron came back with a bunch of prisoners. Highwaymen, apparently.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_15_Wilf_NPC=I'm wondering why they didn't hang them on the spot!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_16_Any_Normal=Hanging, eh? Would that be the normal practice?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_GeneralStore_17_Wilf_NPC=Yes. You don't need that many prisoners to make them talk, if you ask me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Well met again!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC=So - you've had a chance to walk around the city and hear what people are saying?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC=What do you think?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_4_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=The soldiers.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_5_SellswordOrElse_Normal=Something is wrong. Soldiers back from a patrol denied leave…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_6_SellswordOrElse_Normal=…posted to guard duty instead of visiting the tavern.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=These highwaymen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_8_ChoiceB_Spoken=The story with the highwaymen is also weird. Why keep them prisoner?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal=Normally the penalty is clear and swift.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_10_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal=On the frontier, you don't feed idle people, particularly not scum like highwaymen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_11_LawkeeperOrElse_Normal=At best, you put them to work. At worst, they become fertilizer!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_Temp=So what do you think?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC=There are two things I didn't mention in our last conversation.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Things about Roald and the Baron.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_14_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=Roald?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_15_ChoiceA_Spoken=What about Roald?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_16_SergeantNikannen_NPC=When you told me of Roald's death and returned his personal effects…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC=…I was speechless, not out of grief but…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC=…because, not a week before, Roald had come back from patrol!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_19_Any_Default=You mean… one of them is… not who he seems.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=The Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_21_ChoiceB_Spoken=What about the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_22_SergeantNikannen_NPC=I have known him for twenty years. I was a founding member of the company.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_23_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Now, for the first time in ten years, I am officer of the day, posted here.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_24_SergeantNikannen_NPC=And that's not all…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_25_SergeantNikannen_NPC=For the last ten years he's always called me Joris. Now, all of a sudden it's back to Nikannen.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_26_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Something is wrong. I can feel it.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_27_SellswordOrElse_Normal=Suggestions, Sarge?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC=The Ceannard mentioned your mission. He and I go way back.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_29_SergeantNikannen_NPC=So - go see the baron and tell him your heirloom story.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_30_SergeantNikannen_NPC=I know what his normal reaction would be…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_31_SergeantNikannen_NPC=…so come back and we can compare notes.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_32_SergeantNikannen_NPC=And if I were you, I wouldn't mention Roald, the caravan, or anything else…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_33_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Slang=As the philosopher said, we must hang together or we'll hang separately!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_34_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Clear skies to you!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_35_SellswordOrElse_Slang=Clear skies, Sarge! Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_1_BaronStonefist_NPC=Greetings, adventurers.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_2_BaronStonefist_NPC=Sergeant Nikannen says you want to see me on some urgent matter?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_3_DiplomatOrAristocratOrElse_Normal=Yes. It concerns our traveling companion, Lady Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_4_BaronStonefist_NPC=Then let her speak for herself!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_5_Kythaela_NPC=My lord, before the Cataclysm this valley was in the care of my family.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_6_Kythaela_NPC=Alas, only a few of us managed to survive - and none at all in the valley.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_7_BaronStonefist_NPC=A sad tale, my lady, but not uncommon. Those were dire times.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_8_Kythaela_NPC=My father passed away recently. Upon his death bed…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_9_Kythaela_NPC=…he mentioned some family heirlooms left in a hidden room somewhere in the fortress.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_10_Kythaela_NPC=With your leave, my lord…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_11_Kythaela_NPC=…I would like to search for this hidden room and retrieve my family's belongings.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_12_BaronStonefist_NPC=Out of the question! This is my castle and all in it belongs to me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_13_BaronStonefist_NPC=Now begone - and be glad that, as a guest, you are protected by our customs…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Firstmet_14_BaronStonefist_NPC=…otherwise, your impudence would land you in the dungeon!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_1_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Ah - you're back! How did the audience go?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_2_CynicOrElse_Normal=Clear skies! Well, he didn't imprison us, just threw us out!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_3_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Just threw you out? That's not like him at all!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_4_CynicOrElse_Normal=Oh? He's not always so generous to strangers?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_5_SergeantNikannen_NPC=No - just pragmatic and smart!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=Pragmatic?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_7_ChoiceA_Spoken=Pragmatic?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_8_SergeantNikannen_NPC=It would be cheaper to let you find the heirlooms, under close escort.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_9_SergeantNikannen_NPC=He'd demand a fee, but it's easier than having to search for himself!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=Smart?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_11_ChoiceB_Spoken=Smart?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_12_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Of course, smart! If we assume Lady Kythaela's story is true…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_13_SergeantNikannen_NPC=…then arresting her or coercing her could have drawn the ire of an elven clan.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_14_SergeantNikannen_NPC=A pretty stupid move for stuff which might only have sentimental value!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_15_SergeantNikannen_NPC=So, not like Gromnir at all!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_16_SellswordOrElse_Normal=Fine. What do you suggest?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_17_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Let me make some preparations. You go back to him tomorrow…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_18_SergeantNikannen_NPC=…as envoys of the Legacy Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Nikannen_02_10_ChoiceC_WRITTEN=So, what's the plan?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_1_Baron_NPC=Sergeant Nikannen, why are you bringing these people to me again?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_2_SergeantNikannen_NPC=My lord, they showed me credentials that I thought you should see.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_3_Baron_NPC=Credentials? What do credentials have to do with Lady Kythaela's claims?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_4_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal=We're from the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_5_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Formal=My lord, we are deputies of the Legacy Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_6_Baron_NPC=And the Legacy Council interferes in Coparann's affairs?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_7_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal=Quite the contrary, my lord…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_8_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal=…the Council would appreciate Coparann's help.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_9_Baron_NPC=Why didn't you say so yesterday?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_10_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal=We do not flaunt our allegiance unless there is need, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_11_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal=Lady Kythaela works for the Legacy Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_12_LawkeeperOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal=Lady Kythaela has agreed to help the Council…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_13_AcademicOrElse_Normal=…in a delicate and vital matter.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_14_Baron_Normal=And what's that?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal=Historical research.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_16_Baron_NPC=Those… baubles have some historical value?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_17_DiplomatOrElse_Normal=We believe so, my lord. We wouldn't be here otherwise.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_18_Baron_NPC=Then why not just say so?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal=Confidential matters are best handled confidentially, my lord.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_20_Baron_NPC=Then - ah, shall we search for these heirlooms together?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_21_Baron_NPC=I shall escort you and we'll inventory the… historical items.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_22_Baron_NPC=Then we can discuss a reasonable share for the keep.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_23_Kythaela_NPC=That would be more than fair, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_24_Baron_NPC=Then please lead the way! Where should we start?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_25_Kythaela_NPC=In the basement, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_26_Baron_NPC=Let's go, then! Nikannen, you were right to bring them to me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_27_Baron_NPC=Now, back to your post!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_28_SergeantNikannen_NPC=Yes, my lord!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Baron_Return_29_MeetYouThere=Go. I'll meet you in the basement.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_1_Kythaela_NPC=Here! This is the place!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_2_Baron_NPC=And so near the dungeons. How subtle - and fitting.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_3_Baron_NPC=Please, Lady Kythaela, before we inventory your heirlooms…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_4_Baron_NPC=…there is something I wish to show you.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_5_Baron_NPC=You will find it interesting, hopefully.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_6_Baron_NPC=So nice of you to drop by.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_7_Baron_NPC=Now we shall all have a nice, long chat together!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_8_Baron_NPC=And you will tell us everything!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_9_Baron_NPC=Ah - and guards… Gromnir has outlived his usefulness!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_10_EinarOrElse_Formal=Einar be your judge!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_11_Baron_NPC=And you will give me that Crown!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Basement_12_SeeingTheBaron=Is that… the Baron?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_1_Baron_NPC=Lady Kythaela, dear friends - words aren't enough to convey my thanks!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_2_Baron_NPC=Your swift action has saved my life - and our vale!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_3_Baron_NPC=We shall be more wary of the Council's warnings…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_4_Baron_NPC=…the Soraks are real.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_5_Baron_NPC=This changes our position towards the Council.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=Warnings?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_7_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=About the Council…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_8_ChoiceC_WRITTEN=About the Soraks…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_9_ChoiceA_Spoken=The Council warned you?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_10_Baron_NPC=Indeed. I thought they exaggerated, alas!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_11_Baron_NPC=If anything, they weren't loud enough!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_12_DiplomatOrElse_Default=But we can only warn!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_13_Ceannard_NPC=You are right to do so, but in such matters, only conviction and proof are effective!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_14_SellswordOrElse_Slang=Soraks are real - you saw them with your own eyes.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_15_DiplomatOrElse_Normal=Their presence was a clear message: be wary! Be careful!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_16_Ceannard_NPC=True! We won't let our guard down!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_17_Any_Default=How does this change your position?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_18_Ceannard_NPC=Coparann must stand with the Council!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_19_DiplomatOrElse_Normal=Do you plan to join the Council?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_20_DiplomatOrElse_Normal=Or simply to help us in our endeavors?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_21_Ceannard_NPC=We shall join! The discovery of the hidden Gate…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_22_Ceannard_NPC=…will allow us to communicate swiftly!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_23_Ceannard_NPC=But enough about matters of state!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_24_Baron_NPC=The Ceannard has the right of it!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_25_Baron_NPC=The only benefit of power is the ability to reward friends!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_26_Ceannard_NPC=And true friends of Coparann you have proven to be!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_27_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal=Thanks for your kind words! We feel quite rewarded.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_28_DiplomatOrElse_Normal=Hush, you! Ceannard, Lord Stonefist - many thanks for your kind words!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_29_DiplomatOrElse_Normal=And praise be your resilience, so we could rescue you alive!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_30_Baron_NPC=That resilience would have amounted to nothing…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_31_Baron_NPC=…without your insight and your courage!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_32_Baron_NPC=You are hereby granted permanent citizenship of Coparann, with all associated rights!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_33_Baron_NPC=As well as free use of our rediscovered Gate!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_34_Cynic_Or_Else_Normal=The keys to the town, maybe?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_35_Baron_NPC=And these gems from our mines are well suited to holding enchantments.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_36_Baron_NPC=Go forth on your journey with our blessings!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_BaronSaved_37_DiplomatOrElse_Normal=Many thanks for your generous gifts! May Einar watch over Coparann!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_1_Kythaela_NPC=This is the place!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_2_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal=And it's had recent visitors. Look here in the mud - a boot print.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_3_Perception15Success_Normal=And the rain has only just stopped! Let's be careful!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_4_Perception15Failure_Normal=Difficult to read anything here.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_5_SpyOrRangerOrElse_Normal=Lady Kythaela! Do you know how to enter the Tower?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_6_Kythaela_NPC=Yes!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_7_Crownbearer_Normal=Let's head there now!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_8_BroodB_NPC=Not so fast!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_9_BroodD_NPC=The feast is just starting!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Tower_10_BroodF_NPC=And you will make a nice main dish!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_1_Kythaela_NPC=Master, here I am, at last!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_2_Adrasteia_NPC=Kythaela, come to me!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_3_Starter_Normal=Kythaela could use some healing, I think!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_6_Razan_NPC=Yes, dazzle us! Allow me to thank you for your actions!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_7_Razan_NPC=I have tried for years to open that door! And here you are!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_8_Razan_NPC=An answer to my prayers! It would almost lead me to believe…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_9_Razan_NPC=…in the benevolence of the gods! Albeit my very existence proves otherwise!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_1_Adrasteia_NPC=You have my thanks, whoever you are.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_2_Crownbearer_Normal=You're welcome, I guess. But your thanks for what exactly?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_3_Adrasteia_NPC=For reuniting me with Kythaela.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_4_Adrasteia_NPC=For dealing with this… foulness when I was incapacitated.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_5_Adrasteia_NPC=This evil was new to me, not something Manacalon ever knew.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_6_ChoiceA_WRITTEN=Reuniting?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_7_ChoiceA_Spoken=Reunited with her?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_8_Adrasteia_NPC=Yes, Kythaela was - or even is - a part of me!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_9_Judgmental_Normal=Did you kill her?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal=Careful, now!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_11_Adrasteia_NPC=No, It is also me speaking, my friend, and your care is much appreciated!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_12_Insight_20_Success_Normal=Kythaela was your clone?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_13_Insight_20_Failure_Normal=I don't understand what happened here!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_14_Adrasteia_NPC=Kythaela was a last-ditch contingency - one I didn't truly think I would ever need!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_15_Adrasteia_NPC=A vessel for my knowledge and memories!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_16_AcademicOrElse_Normal=But how did she awaken, a thousand years after the Cataclysm?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_17_Adrasteia_NPC=The revival process was tied to an ambient level of mana.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_18_AcademicOrElse_Normal=Very high-level magic, then!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_19_Adrasteia_NPC=One of the secrets of the Arcaneum, yes!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_20_ChoiceB_WRITTEN=Incapacitated?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_21_ChoiceB_Normal=Incapacitated?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_22_Adrasteia_Spoken=Yes, the merging process takes time - time during which I was almost helpless!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_23_ChoiceC_WRITTEN=Never seen such a creature?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_24_ChoiceC_Normal=Never met such a creature before?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_25_Adrasteia_NPC=No. Manacalon, for all its faults, revered life!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_26_Adrasteia_NPC=This was a negation of life, an abomination!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_27_AcademicOrElse_Normal=Manacalon? Are you one of the… ?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_28_Adrasteia_NPC=Adrasteia the Prudent Shield, Master of Abjuration. In your debt, and at your service!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_29_AcademicOrElse_Normal=You were at the battle of the Rift?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_30_Adrasteia_NPC=Yes, and there I must apologize for Kythaela's misconceptions.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_31_AcademicOrElse_Normal=Misconceptions?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_32_Adrasteia_NPC=Yes. She was created with an elven personality, and carried certain… prejudices.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_33_AcademicOrElse_Normal=Oh, that.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_34_Adrasteia_NPC=The Empire wasn't kind to… other races.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_35_AcademicOrElse_Normal=The humans surprised you, it seems.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_36_Adrasteia_NPC=Yes - such bravery, such defiance!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_37_Adrasteia_NPC=They all came together to save Solasta!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_38_Adrasteia_NPC=The Golden Cavalry charging and breaking the lines of the Sorr-Akkath!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_39_Adrasteia_NPC=The Iron Legions and the Shield Wall of the dwarves…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_40_Adrasteia_NPC=…holding the enemy at bay, flank to flank!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_41_Adrasteia_NPC=Our shock arcanists and the human paladins together…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_42_Adrasteia_NPC=…giving their lives to give us a chance to close the Rift!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_43_Adrasteia_NPC=And, as another wave came through…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_44_Adrasteia_NPC=…one last throw of the dice…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_45_Adrasteia_NPC=…one last surprise for the Sorr-Akkath!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_46_AcademicOrElse_Normal=What was it?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_47_Adrasteia_NPC=Kaseinax had us walking Solasta in elven form for so long…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_48_Adrasteia_NPC=…but at this moment we resumed our true forms!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_49_Adrasteia_NPC=To secure the Rift for a few crucial moments…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_50_Adrasteia_NPC=…buying time with our lives in a furnace of magic and steel!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_51_Adrasteia_NPC=So Kaseinax finished his ritual!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_52_AcademicOrElse_Normal=With the gems.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_53_Adrasteia_NPC=Take it, old friend, once again.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_54_Crownbearer_Normal=Old friend?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_55_Adrasteia_NPC=I feel your spirit in the Crown, Kaseinax!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_56_AcademicOrElse_normal=The Magister is still in the Crown?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_57_Adrasteia_NPC=Enough talk of the past.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC=Please accept these few tokens of my gratitude!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_58_Adrasteia_NPC2=I must rest now. I foresee one last flight, when the need is greatest…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC=…and for that, I will need all my strength.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_59_Adrasteia_NPC2=Use my Gate freely. I believe you know how.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC=We shall meet again, before the end!
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC2=But before you take your leave, if you would be so kind…
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_60_Adrasteia_NPC3=This creature you forced to flee still plagues my grounds with his minions.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_61_Adrasteia_NPC=Would you deal with them and free their prisoners?
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_62_Adrasteia_NPC=As a courtesy.
Narration/&AbjurationEnding_63_Any_Default=We owe you that much. Thank you, Master Adrasteia.
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Welcome=Welcome to the inn!
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_StayForTheNight=Sure! Get settled!
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Nomoney=No coin, no bed.
Narration/&AbjurationMildred_Tavern_Goodbye=Stay in the light!
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_1_Atima_NPC=Sun on your face, travelers!
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_2_Atima_NPC=My name is Atima Bladeburn, priestess of Arun.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_3_Arun_Default=A herald of fire?
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_4_Atima_NPC=It is my honor.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_5_Atima_NPC=What can I do for you?
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_6_Arun_Default=Just passing by to pay our respects.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_7_Cynical_Default=Not me.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_8_Atima_NPC=Then good luck and fair weather, friends.
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_9_Any_Default=Stay in the light!
Narration/&Abjuration_Coparann_Atima_10_Any_Default=We need your powers.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_1_Ceannard_NPC=Gromnir! Thank Einar you're safe!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_2_BaronStonefist_NPC=Yes, I am - thanks to Joris and these adventurers, it seems!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_3_Ceannard_NPC=Now, old friend - go see Atima with Joris!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_4_BaronStonefist_NPC=I'm fine!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_5_Ceannard_NPC=I knew you'd say that.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_6_Ceannard_NPC=I am the Ceannard, and you…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_7_Ceannard_NPC=…you shall resume your duties only if our cleric says you're fit enough.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_8_BaronStonefist_NPC=But -
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_9_Ceannard_NPC=No buts! I shall secure the Keep and the valley till you're back!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_10_Ceannard_NPC=As for you, my friends, find Lady Kythaela's belongings…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_11_Ceannard_NPC=…and meet me in the throne room.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_12_CrownbearerOrHighestHistory_Formal=Strike true!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Jail_Aftermath_12_CrownbearerOrHighestHistory_Normal=Will do.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_1_CrownbearerOrArcane_Highest_Normal=Tell us, Lady Kythaela, what did you find? A gem?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_2_Kythaela_NPC=This is my spellbook - I remember!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_2b_Kythaela_NPC=A wand, a robe, some money, and a piece of paper.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_3_CrownbearerOrHighestInsighet_Normal=What does it say?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_4_Kythaela_NPC=I… don't know. There is only one word written on the paper: "Adrasteo"
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_5_SarcasticOrElse_Normal=Is that another place?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_6_Kythaela_NPC=I… I'm not sure! I feel the pull returning!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_7_InsightOrElse_Normal=I guess we'll soon be on the road again, then.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_8_SarcasticOrElse_Normal=More monsters to kill… fantastic…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_Gear_9_PerceptionHighest_Normal=What about that door? Another secret from Imperial times?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_1_ArcanaHighest_Normal=A Major Gate! Captain Ironshell was right.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_2_Sarcastic_Normal=About the cleanliness of the rooms in the Residence?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_3_ArcanaHighest_Normal=About functional Gates, you dimwit!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_4_Sarcastic_Normal=This dusty old room?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_5_ArcanaHighest_Normal=Yes, look at it! It's perfectly intact.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_8_Kythaela_NPC=It is locked, though.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_9_InsightHighest_Normal=How do we unlock it?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_10_Kythaela_NPC=You need to use its name.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_11_Kythaela_NPC=It would normally be engraved nearby, but this was a private, secret Gate.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_12_Pragmatic_Normal=So, we can't use it?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_13_Kythaela_NPC=I know its name, this was my family's.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_14_Pragmatic_Normal=So…?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_15_Kythaela_NPC=Once you get me to my master, I'll give you the name.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_16_Pragmatic_Normal=I guess that's fair.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_17_Friendly_Normal=And then, we teleport to Caer Cyflen?
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_18_Friendly_Normal=That's fantastic!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_19_Pragmatic_Normal=I'm not sure the Ceannard will want to wait.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_20_Kythaela_NPC=Then I'll give him the name, but you still have to stay with me.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_21_Cynical_Default=She's tough, but at least she doesn't sound crazy anymore.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_22_Kythaela_NPC=Watch your words, you…
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Kythaela_CoparannGateroom_23_Kythaela_NPC=…never mind.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_1_Default_Default=This is the worst place we've been so far.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_2_Reactor_Normal=It sure does stink - sulfur, I think.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_3_Reactor_Slang=And it stinks like an orc's backside.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_4_Reactor_Formal=Indeed, the smell here is awful.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_5_Pragmatic_Default=We're deep in the Badlands, sure - but there is a gem around here.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_6_Selfpres_Default=You never know. Remember the Gem of Abjuration?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_7_Selfpres_Default=The Crown's signal was just a decoy to find Kythaela.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Arriving_8_Default_Default=Look, is that an orc totem?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_9_Default_Default=An orc… woman?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_10_Kill_CHOICE=Let's kill her!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_11_Save_CHOICE=We could save her.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_12_Leave_CHOICE=Let's move on.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_13_Speak_CHOICE=Let's think about it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_14_Kill_Default=It's an orc. We kill orcs, right?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_15_Pragmatic_Default=She might know something about the gem.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_16_Save_Default=She's helpless! Let's show mercy for once.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_17_Kill_Slang=No glory in slaughtering someone who's already down.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_18_Kill_Formal=I say we save her life - even if she probably wouldn't do the same for us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_19_Medecine_Default=I'll take care of that - she'll be on her feet very soon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_20_Leave_Default=Who cares? Let's keep looking for the gem.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_21_Speak_Default=What's the risk, here? She's alone and wounded.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_22_Arcana_Default=She's a shaman. She could cast a spell on us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_23_Pragmatic_Default=Maybe she knows something about the gem.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_24_Nosy_Default=To be honest, I'd like to know what happened here. Who killed all those orcs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_25_Kebra_NPC=You… healed me?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_26_Kebra_NPC=Why not kill me?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_27_Neutral_Choice=What happened?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_28_Friendly_CHOICE=Who are you?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_29_Pragmatic_CHOICE=Have you heard of a magic gem?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_30_Orcishspeaker_CHOICE=Trust us. (in orcish)
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_31_Pragmatic_Default=We'd like to know what happened here.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_32_Friendly_Default=What's your name?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_33_Kebra_NPC=Name is Kebra…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_34_Kebra_NPC=…shaman of Suncloud tribe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_35_Pragmatic_Default=We're looking for a magic gem. Know anything about that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_36_Kebra_NPC=Magic gem?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_37_Kebra_NPC=I heard stories of magic stones.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_38_Kebra_NPC=Old stories, orc never found any.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_39_Orcishspeaker_Default=Nyark ami anda.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_40_Kebra_NPC=A nyark who speaks orc!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_41_Kebra_NPC=Kebra like to know your story.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_42_Kebra_NPC=But this is not time for that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_43_Kebra_NPC=My people. All dead.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_44_Kebra_NPC=Arrok did that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_45_Kebra_NPC=Arrok is Redscar tribe shaman, powerful.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_46_Kebra_NPC=But so powerful… I not know.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_47_Pragmatic_Default=Other orcs did this?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_48_Kebra_NPC=Many tribes in the Cradle of Fire, always fighting.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_49_Kebra_NPC=Arrok always ambitious.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_50_Kebra_NPC=But now Arrok has power of fire.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_51_Nosy_CHOICE=The Cradle of Fire?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_52_Pragmatic_CHOICE=Power of fire?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_53_Nosy_Default=The Cradle of Fire?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_54_Pragmatic_Default=New power? You said Arrok was more powerful than you thought?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FindingKebra_55_Kebra_NPC=Orc name for volcano.

Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_02_7_Pragmatic_Default=There has to be a way.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_1_Cynical_Default=I promise I'll never scoff at 'anything is possible in the Badlands' again.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_2_Pragmatic_Default=At least we got it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_3_Pragmatic_Default=Hopefully, that means another orc tribe behind us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_4_Greed_Default=You really want to give up this axe?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_5_Greed_Default=Look at it? it's a masterpiece!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_6_Nosy_Default=Tirmarian smiths were just as good as the elves of Manacalon!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_7_Nosy_Default=This axe is fantastic!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_8_Greed_Default=I say we keep it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_03_9_Authority_Default=The gem's more important - and to get that, we need to give the axe to Bladefang.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_1_Radulf_NPC=Brok is back with nyarks?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_2_Radulf_NPC=Have the…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_3_WRITTEN_Pragmatic=Here, your axe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_4_WRITTEN_Greed=We'll keep it.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_5_Pragmatic_Default=Here it is, your holy axe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_6_Radulf_NPC=I knew it was real!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_7_Radulf_NPC=It is magnificent.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_8_Cynical_Default=Nice vocabulary.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_9_Radulf_NPC=You made Bladefang more powerful than ever!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_10_Radulf_NPC=We follow you against Arrok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_11_Greed_Default=It was too hard to get it, it's ours now.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_12_Radulf_NPC=But axe is orc inheritance.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_13_Greed_Default=It's Tirmarian, not orc.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_14_Radulf_NPC=Pah! Should know better than trust nyarks!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_OldQueen_04_15_Radulf_NPC=Leave Bladefang. Now.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_1_Default_Default=Look at that! Another library!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_2_Default2_Default=It looks very like the tower where we found the Crown.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_3_History_Default=But it's makeshift, not Manacalon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_4_Kebra_NPC=Home of Sandraven, and Shaman Urka.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_5_Nosy_WRITTEN=Why the Manacalon style?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_6_Pragmatic_WRITTEN=Tell us about the Sandraven tribe.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_7_Authority_WRITTEN=Let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_8_Nosy_Default=Why is this place made of Manacalon remnants?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_9_Kebra_NPC=Urka very wise shaman.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_10_Kebra_NPC=Reads books.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_11_Nosy_Default=Orcs can read?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_12_Cynical_Default=Amaaazing.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_13_Pragmatic_Default=What should we know about Sandraven?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_14_Kebra_NPC=Urka loves old elf stuff.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_15_Kebra_NPC=Ask you to bring back some, for sure.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_16_Kebra_NPC=But his tribe can fight, useful for facing Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_17_Authority_Default=Let's do this. I think they've seen us, anyway.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_18_Urka_NPC=Kebra?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_19_Urka_NPC=I thought you were dead.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_20_Urka_NPC=Who are your nyark… friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_21_Kebra_NPC=They help me and Brok. We gather all tribes against Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_22_Urka_NPC=Oh, Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_23_Authority_Default=Urka, eh?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_24_Urka_NPC=Yes.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_25_Authority_Default=We need your tribe to support Brok's challenge against Arrok.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_26_Urka_NPC=Hmmm. First, bring me the key to the sunken city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_27_Authority_Default=What's that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_28_Urka_NPC=Down in the Cradle of Fire is a Manacalon city called Sentharyllian.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_29_Urka_NPC=It melted into the mountain, since the Great Collapse.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_30_Urka_NPC=But Arrok… he found it first.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_31_Urka_NPC=Found his stone of power there.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_32_Urka_NPC=Now, no one can enter, unless…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_33_Urka_NPC=…unless you go through the Necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_34_Urka_NPC=Find the Emperor's key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_35_Urka_NPC=Bring it back to me, and my tribe will support Suncloud.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_36_Choice1_WRITTEN=It's a deal!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_37_Choice2_WRITTEN=Arrok is already in the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_38_Choice3_WRITTEN=The Emperor's key?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_39_Choice4_WRITTEN=It must be very dangerous.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_40_Choice4_Default=If Arrok the powerful didn't go there, it must be awfully dangerous.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_41_Urka_NPC=Not more than facing Arrok without help.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_42_Choice3_Default=What is this key?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_43_Urka_NPC=It is said that the Emperor was buried with a magical key that opens the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_44_Urka_NPC=So find his tomb and bring me the key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_45_Choice2_Default=Why do you want that key if Arrok is already inside the city?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_46_Urka_NPC=Arrok only found a part of the city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_47_Urka_NPC=The key will open many more rooms… to me.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_SandRaven_48_Choice1_Default=All right, we'll bring you the key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_1_Default_Default=I think that's the Necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_2_Selfpres_Default=Orcs don't go there? I really can't see why.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Entrance_3_Authority_Default=Let's go find this key.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_1_Default_Default=That's a change of mood.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_2_Nosy_Default=Fantastic! It's like traveling back in time a thousand years!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Hall_3_Selfpres_Default=Well, it still stinks of sulfur.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_1_Default_Default=So far, this looks more like a museum than a crypt.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_2_History_Default=Manacalon custom. The tombs of the powerful have a hall of honor before the burial chamber.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_3_Greed_Default=It's a map of the Manacalon Empire! It must be a thousand years old - maybe more!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_4_Cynical_Default=So, they really did rule the world.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_5_Greed_Default=This is invaluable. I should compare it to our own map.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_6_History_Default=Here - this is Hickory Corner Wood! I've been there, and there's nothing but an old statue. The map shows an outpost!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_7_Pragmatic_Default=Maybe it's buried, like this city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Map_8_Authority_Default=Let's put that on our map - maybe someday we can go check it out.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_1_History_Default=We have our answer - this isn't just any tomb.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_2_Cynical_Default=Yeah, it's a damned Imperial slaver's tomb.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_3_Lawful_Default=We know…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_4_History_Default=This one was Laethar Aerlinn, first of his name.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_5_Pragmatic_Default=In the middle of the Badlands, and not in the capital city? That's weird.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_6_History_Default=It might have been displaced during the Cataclysm and sunk down here.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_7_Lawful_Default=I would have expected something bigger, fancier.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_8_Cynical_Default=Maybe he was a modest Emperor - if such a thing's possible.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue01_9_Authority_Default=We still need to find an entrance to the city. Let's go!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_1_History_Default=Prince Kealin, firstborn.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_2_Violent_Default=His son? Never got to be Emperor - died too soon.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_3_Cynical_Default=Murdered, most likely. Happy families, and all that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue02_4_Authority_Default=Let's go.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_1_History_Default=Queen Saefinala, dearest wife and mother.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_2_Cynical_Default=Cute.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_3_Lawful_Default=Show some respect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_Statue03_4_Carver_Default=Slavers, the whole lot of them.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_1_Ghost_NPC=Who dares disturb the eternal rest of Emperor Laethar?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_2_Default_WRITTENONLY=We mean no disrespect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_3_Deception_WRITTENONLY=We got lost.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_4_Persuasion_WRITTENONLY=We're clearing your city of orcs.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_5_Intimidation_WRITTENONLY=We go where we like.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_6_Intimidation_Answer01=This isn't your world anymore - we can go wherever we like!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_7_Ghost_NPC=Fool!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_8_Ghost_NPC=Your souls will never leave this tomb!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_9_Persuasion_Answer02=Your city is infested with orcs. We're here to clean it up.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_10_Ghost_NPC=What are orcs?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_11_Cynical_Default=Smart move!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_12_Persuasion_Default=Evil monsters. They're desecrating your city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_13_Deception_Answer03=We just got lost, sorry.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_14_Ghost_NPC=Lies of a tomb robber!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_15_Default_Answer04=We mean no disrespect.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_16_Ghost_NPC=Then what do you mean?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_17_Ghost_NPC=Monsters, you say?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_18_Ghost_NPC=Clearly, you are runaway slaves. You will be punished!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_19_Violent_Slang=I've had enough of this. Let's kill this loser - again!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_20_Violent_Normal=Enough of this! Let's wipe this slaver's ghost from Solasta!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_21_Persuasion_Default=We call them orcs, they're like… dwarves, but worse.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_22_Ghost_NPC=Really?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_23_Ghost_NPC=Then you are on a sacred mission.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_24_Ghost_NPC=Monsters must not defile a city of the Emperors.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_25_Ghost_NPC=Leave this holy tomb and do what you must.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_26_Ghost_NPC=There is Minor Gate by the tapestry of the Aer Elai. Use it to reach the inner city.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_EmperorGhost_27_Persuasion_Default=Thank you, your Imperial Majesty.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_1_Pragmatic_Default=Did you see that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_2_Cynical_Default=The ghost? Yes, we did.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_3_Pragmatic_Default=The key! It's in the coffin.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_4_Selfpres_Default=Oh, no!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_5_Pragmatic_Default=So what do we do?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_6_Cynical_Default=Wake him up again and ask nicely?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_7_Violent_Default=Get ready for a fight.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_8_Pragmatic_Default=Why don't we just go into the city and kill Arrok?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_AfterGhost_9_Selfpres_Default=Which is worse? Fighting Arrok by ourselves, or this dead Emperor?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_1_Ghost_NPC=You again?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_2_Cynical_Normal=Sorry, your Imperialness. We just need that pretty key of yours.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_3_Cynical_Formal=Our apologies, Emperor, but your time has long gone.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_4_Cynical_Slang=Time to die for good, dead boy!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_GhostReturn_5_Ghost_NPC=Liars! Traitors!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_1_Authority_Default=Urka!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_2_Urka_NPC=I must say, I am impressed.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_3_Selfpres_Default=You followed us?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_4_Urka_NPC=So you don't have to bring the key back to me.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_5_Selfpres_Default=You really want that key, don't you?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_6_Urka_NPC=Actually, I wanted the ghost to weaken you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaReveals_7_Urka_NPC=Make it easier to take that Crown from you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_1_Kebra_NPC=Urka? How? I know him since… child.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_2_Lawful_Default=The Soraks - the gaks - they got to him, I guess.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_3_Kebra_NPC=But, all these orcs, too?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_4_History_Default=The Soraks took over a whole world back on Tirmar.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_5_Kebra_NPC=The Crown? It can stop them?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_6_Authority_Default=We think so - hope so.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Necropolis_UrkaKilled_7_Kebra_NPC=You need Arrok's stone, for real.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_1_Brok_NPC=Nyark friends. You convince the tribes?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_2_Authority_Default=Bad news. Urka was corrupted by the gaks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_3_Brok_NPC=Urka? Big mind like him?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_4_Kebra_NPC=I saw him. Like crazy. The gaks can do this.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_5_Brok_NPC=Maybe Arrok is gak, too?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_6_Authority_Default=Doesn't matter now, we need to take the fight to him.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_7_Brok_NPC=But Sandraven?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_8_Kebra_NPC=You choose a chief for them, and they follow you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_9_Default_Default=Also, Radulf will not come.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_10_Default_Default=We couldn't reach an agreement.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_BackToBrok_11_Brok_NPC=Hm. Meet us near Redscar gate.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_12_Default_Player=What is that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_13_Brok_NPC=Redscar gate. Arrok's fortress.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_14_Violence_Player=Can't we just kill the guards and go in?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_15_Brok_NPC=Door is magic.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_16_Brok_NPC=But Arrok will open if challenged.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_NearRedScarGate_17_Brok_NPC=We need the tribes.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_1_History_NPC=Can't get used to these Minor Gates. To think they had these everywhere!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_2_Pragmatic_Default=Now's not the time for Manacalon nostalgia.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_3_Kebra_NPC=Look!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_4_Authority_Default=Is that…?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_5_Kebra_NPC=Arrok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_6_Cynical_Default=That did the trick, eh?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_7_Selfpres_Default=What are these burned corpses everywhere?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_8_Kebra_NPC=Orcs. Didn't please Arrok, I suppose.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_9_Cynical_Default=Well, looks like he did half the job for us.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_10_Authority_NPC=Do we need the tribes, now?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_11_Violent_NPC=I reckon we can take him - we have the advantage of surprise.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_12_Kebra_NPC=Arrok still very powerful.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_13_Violent_NPC=Sure. So we need to take him down fast.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_InsideCity_14_Selfpres_NPC=We can still backtrack and follow the plan.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_1_Cynical_Default=Uh-huh.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_2_Arrok_NPC=Ah, Kebra of Suncloud…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_3_Arrok_NPC=…you walk with nyarks? Shame on you.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_4_Authority_Default=You're finished, Arrok. Give us the stone!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_5_Arrok_NPC=Funny nyark. No, you give me yours.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_6_Authority_Default=You're alone. Looks like you killed your tribe all by yourself.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_7_Arrok_NPC=Useless worms.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_8_Arrok_NPC=Arrok needs no orcs. Arrok is fire! Arrok is volcano!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_FaceArrok_9_Selfpres_Default=What the…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_1_Authority_Default=Brok!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_2_Authority_Default=Where are the guards?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_3_Brok_NPC=Surrendered.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_4_Default_Default=What?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_5_Brok_NPC=So afraid of Arrok, they joined us already.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_6_Cynical_Default=No big speech, then?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_7_Brok_NPC=No, but door still closed.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_8_Crownbearer_Default=Do you see that?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_9_Cynical_Default=The door?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_10_Crownbearer_Default=No, there is a… power.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_11_Crownbearer_Default=I think, though… with the Crown… we might be able to enter.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_12_Selfpres_Default=It's a trap. Arrok wants us in there alone.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_13_Pragmatic_Default=Do we have a choice?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_TribesUnite_14_Default_Default=There's always the Necropolis.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_1_Nosy_Default=Is that gem more powerful than the others?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_2_Arcane_Default=Orc shamans wield a very peculiar type of magic…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_3_Arcane_Default=…the gem must have been some sort of catalyst.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_ArrokDefeated_4_Pragmatic_Default=Well, we have it now. Let's move before this place blows up!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_1_Selfpres_Default=That was close!
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_2_Friendly_Default=What do you think happened to…
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_3_Friendly_NPC=…our orc friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_4_Selfish_Default=You mean yours. They're no friends of mine.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_5_Violent_Default=Burned dead… who cares?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_6_Friendly_Default=They seem more civilized than I expected.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_7_Violent_Default=Next time we run into some, you can tell them that.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Ending_8_Authority_Default=All right, let's get out of here. It's not safe!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_1_Crownbearer_Default=This is it, I think! It's just behind this wall of vegetation!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_2_CynicOrElse_Default=You think? That's comforting. And how do we get through?
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default=Just hack and slash, rinse and repeat, until we're through!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4a_CynicOrElse_Default=I've heard that before…
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4b_CynicOrElse_Default=…a couple of hundred times since we started…
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_4c_HighestCharismaIfNotCynicOrnotCynic_Default=Oh, come on! Less bitching and more hacking!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_5_LowestSTRorElse_Default=I so love manual labor!
Narration/&Conjuration_Entrance_6_FollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default=It's Maraike's will!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_1_CynicOrElse_Default=I think my arm's about to drop off from all this hacking!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_2_SellswordorElse_Slang=Chop, don't talk!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default=Come on, guys! It's just another hedge!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_4_LowestSTRorElse_Default=Last freakin' hedge I intend to cut through in my lifetime!
Narration/&Conjuration_Jungle_5_RogueOrFollowerMaraikeOrElse_Default=Misaye's laughing!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_1_LowestSTRorElse_Default=Such a wonderful coincidence to get a sauna after all the physical exertion!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_2_SellswordorElse_Slang=Stop moaning - it was just a nice warm-up!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_3_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default=I have dealt with worse! Not often, though!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_4_CynicOrElse_Default=Hard to believe!
Narration/&Conjuration_Lava_5_AthleticProficientOrRangerOrElse_Default=Einar strike down me if I lie!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_1_SpyOrElse_Default=Now, my friend - it's time for a little chat.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_2_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC=I'll give you nothing! Sorr-Tarr will protect me from your torture!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_3_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=He isn't here, Two-Face - but I am!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_4_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC=This place will be the death of you, too! It is cursed! Its magic is twisted!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=This place? How did you get here?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5a_Written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=How did you come to this place?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC=We were sent by our chosen one!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=An acolyte of Sorr-Tarr…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6a1_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC=Blessed be his name.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a1_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=How did he locate the place?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7a2_Intimidation_DC20_Default=Ever heard of the Inquisition? Talk to us now!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a1_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Success_NPC=The chosen one worked some magic.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8a2_Sorak_Prisoner_Intimidation_Failure_NPC=The Inquisition? Pah! Nothing you can do to me can beat the horrors of this place!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=This place is cursed?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_5b_written_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=What curse?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_6b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC=Don't you have eyes? Didn't you see the fate of my brethren?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_7b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=Won't lose sleep over it! What is cursed?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_8b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC=This very place! Everything seemed peaceful, and then…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_9b_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=Who said what?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_10b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC=The voice! It said we would all die!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_11b_Sorak_Prisoner_NPC=Because I know we will all die here! It said so!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_12_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=Disturbing claims!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_13_SpyOrCautious_Default=Sure, all these dead Soraks, and no trace of what killed them…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_14_SpyOrCautious_Default=…but we saw dead Soraks everywhere…
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_15_SpyOrCautious_Default=…and not one single enemy body among them!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_16_Lawkeeper_Default=They could have taken their dead, just like the Soraks do.
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_17_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=And what do we do with our friend here?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_18_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=He is a Sorak pawn - there is only one thing to do!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_19_LawkeeperOrElse_Default=And yet, we have laws!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_20_PaladinEinarOrSpyOrElse_Default=He's too dangerous!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_21_LawkeeperOrElse_Default=Who are we, to call ourselves judges and executioners?
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_22_AnyPriestOrPaladin_Default=Servants of the gods!
Narration/&Conjuration_Interrogation_23_AnyNonHuman_Default=Protectors of Solasta!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Default=Those statues look weird!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_2_Sellsword_Slang=Perhaps - but those chests look mighty real to me!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_3_LawkeeperOrElse_Default=But are we entitled to it?
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_4_Sellsword_Slang=What do you mean?
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_5_LawkeeperOrElse_Default=So far, we haven't met a living soul in this labyrinth!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_6_CynicOrElse_Default=And your point being?
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_7_LawkeeperOrElse_Default=That we would be stealing from the owner!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_8_SellswordOrGreed_Default=Naaah - spoils of war!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_9_LawkeeperOrElse_Default=But we want his help, remember - stealing makes a bad impression, usually.
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_10_SellswordOrGreed_Default=Can we just take a peek first? We don't have to take anything.
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_11_SellswordOrGreed_Default=Just a look, right?
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_12_LawkeeperOrElse_Default=All right, but don't make me regret it!
Narration/&Conjuration_Treasure_Beast_13_SellswordOrGreed_Default=Oooops… Sorry?
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_1_Beast_NPC=And so the thieves come to meet their doom!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_2_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal=There are no thieves here!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_3_Beast_NPC=Do you deny helping yourselves to the riches outside this room?
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_4_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal=We were looking for clues and then we were attacked…
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default=…by some constructs that really, really wanted to kill us!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_6_Beast_NPC=Hah! The constructs wouldn't have attacked…
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_7_Beast_NPC=…if you had just looked!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8a_SellswordOrGreed_Default=Had to make sure they weren't fake!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_8b_LawkeeperOrAltruist_Default=We didn't even have a chance to put them back!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_9_Beast_NPC=You stole! Otherwise, there would have been no fight!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_10_Beast_NPC=And there is only one punishment for theft!
Narration/&Conjuration_Beast_11_Beast_NPC=Death!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_1_SellswordOrGreed_Slang=This is my kind of fight!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_2_Crownbearer_Default=Well, I can relate to that, but I also wonder…
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Default=Wonder about what?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_4_Crownbearer_Default=Why all of this? Why the traps, why the fights?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_5_NosyOElse_Default=Not to forget the how!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_6_Crownbearer_Default=This gem fragment… resonates with the Crown but…
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_7_NosyOElse_Default=Apparently, the gem was split… to protect it, maybe?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_8_Crownbearer_Default=That would explain the traps and monsters.
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_9_NosyOElse_Default=It's one way to make sure this gem is safe!
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_Self_PreservationOrElse_Default=But what does it mean?
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_10_NosyOElse_Default=That another Master survived the Cataclysm.
Narration/&Conjuration_BeastEnding_11_Cynic_Default=Someone who doesn't like visitors.
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal=What was that? Where are we?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_2_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal=You had to step on it!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_3_SelfPreservationOrSelfishness_Normal=Find us a way back!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_4_NosyOrElse_Formal=Friends, we'll have to think this through! We're a team.
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_5_CynicOrElse_Normal=And watch where you put your hands in future.
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_6_SellswordOrGreed_Normal=Don't you loot everything you find?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_7_NosyOrElse_Normal=I'm not a Scavenger, mind you.
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_8_SellswordOrGreed_Normal=Stop it!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_9_SellswordOrGreed_Normal=…while we wait for you to finish pondering all the…
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_10_SellswordOrGreed_Formal=…theoretical and practical implications of everything we do?
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_11_NosyOrElse_Normal=Nothing wrong with using one's brain, my musclebound friend!
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_12_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal=Enough! Let's find a way out of this trap…
Narration/&Conjuration_ShiftingMaze_13_CrownbearerOrAuthority_Normal=By brawn or brains, I don't care which!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal=I just felt something!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_2_NosyOrElse_Normal=Like what?
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal=Like the floor gave a little under my weight!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_4_NosyOrElse_Formal=Well, this tile does look a little different!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_5_NosyOrElse_Normal=Spread out! Look for similar tiles!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_6_SelfishnessOrGreed_Normal=What's in it for me?
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle_7_NosyOrElse_Normal=A way out! Unless you have a better idea?
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal=It worked! The platform shifted!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_2_NosyOrElse_Normal=True - but we're not out of this… labyrinth yet!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal=True!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_4_NosyOrElse_Formal=We've made progress, though! Let's keep going!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_5_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal=Let's spread out and explore!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_6_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal=Professional trap-finders first!
Narration/&Conjuration_TeleportingCircle2_7_RogueOrHighestPerception_Normal=Did someone just call for my expertise?
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_1_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal=Interesting light, that. Very bright.
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_2_nosyOrElse_Normal=Wonder what it's about?
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_3_HighestPerceptionOrElse_Normal=Only one way to find out! Come on!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_4_Arcana_DC20_Failure_Normal=Looks like a will-o'-the-wisp to me!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_5_Arcana_DC20_Success_Normal=How fascinating! A new wonder to behold!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_6_RogueOrElse_Normal=Not so fast! There have been enough traps so far to…
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_7_RogueOrElse_Normal=…make me really nervous!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_8_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal=You and me both, my friend!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_9_Crownbearer_Normal=Let's tread carefully, then!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_10_RogueOrAcolyte_Normal=Today is Misaye's birthday!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_11_ClericOrWorshipMaraike_Normal=Maraike's will be done!
Narration/&Conjuration_Coward_12_SelfPreservationOrElse_Normal=Next time, pray harder for a miracle!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_1_HighestPerception_Slang=Einar's sword! What a sight!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_2_NosyOrHistoryOrElse_Formal=Unbelievable!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_3_HistoryDC15_Success_Formal=A classical Manacalon manor! What a wonderful sight!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_4_HistoryDC15_Failure_Formal=What a weird old building!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_5_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal=Guys, I move two steps back and well… it's gone!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_6_HighestPerception_Normal=What is gone?
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_7_Self_PreservationOrElse_Normal=This manor! Something weird is going on!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_8_HighestPerception_Normal=Story of my life!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_9_CynicOrElse_Normal=Weird gets us money and fame!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_10_AcolytOrElse_Normal=Do you really have to be so… greedy?
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_11_CynicOrElse_Normal=Not greedy; practical! We do things…
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_12_CynicOrElse_Normal=…that no one in their right minds would attempt…
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_13_CynicOrElse_Normal=…and we don't do it for nothing!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_14_HelpfulnessOrFriendliness_Normal=Speak for yourself! A good deed is a good deed!
Narration/&Conjuration_MansionArrival_15_CynicOrElse_Normal=Then let's get in there and see what kind of weirdness we find!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_1_Butler_NPC=Good day to you. My name is Eldorath Smooth-Tongue, the master's housekeeper.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_1_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC=I see you have purloined some of my master's property…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2a_2_Butler_ifPlayersLooted_NPC=…might I suggest you put those trinkets back where they belong?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_1_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC=Welcome.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_2b_2_Butler_ifPlayersNoLoot_NPC=Please come with me.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_3_CrownbearerOrDiplomatOrElse_Normal=Clear skies to you! Where are you taking us?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_4_Butler_NPC=To the master, of course!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_5_Crownbearer_Normal=And who would that be?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_6_Butler_NPC=That is for not for me to say. All will be made plain in good time.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_7_Butler_NPC=I am at your disposal. Please enjoy our hospitality - but…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_8_Butler_NPC=…please don't abuse it.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=We are grateful for your hospitality.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9a_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=Hospitality?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10a_Butler_NPC=We aim to please. The household has certain standards, after all.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11a_Butler_NPC=We have not seen guests of your… quality for some time.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=Some time? How long, exactly?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13a_Butler_NPC=Well, it must be… forgive me, the date eludes me for the moment.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14a_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=Do you remember any… prominent guests?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15a_Butler_NPC=You were there, Master Kaseinax!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16a_Crownbearer_Normal=Me?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17a_Butler_NPC=I remember it distinctly. Though your form was somewhat different.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=We would never dream of abusing your hospitality!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_9b_written_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=Someone abused your hospitality in the past?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_10b_Butler_NPC=Yes, believe it or not, some… creatures can be…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_11b_Butler_NPC=…insufferably rude!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_12b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=True nobility is reflected in the character!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_13h_Butler_NPC=Quite so! Not, of course, that I thought for a second…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_14b_Butler_NPC=…that you would be capable of such discourtesy.
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_15b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=Of course not! And yet, customs being different everywhere…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_16b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=…might I ask what would be considered rude here?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_17b_Butler_NPC=Well, my expectations don't exceed those of the Imperial court!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_18b_Cynic_Slang=So, don't piss in the potted plants, then?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_19b_Butler_NPC=Preferably not. Not that it would be the first time…
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_20b_DiplomatOrElse_Formal=Really?
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_21b_Butler_NPC=I have seen worse, I'm sorry to say!
Narration/&Conjuration_CastleEntrance_22b_Butler_NPC=But now, please follow me. One mustn't keep the master waiting!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_1_Master_NPC=Well met, strangers!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_2_Master_IfplayersStole_NPC=Ah, my little thieving visitors.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_3_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal=Clear skies to you, master.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_4_Master_NPC=Clear skies? An ironic greeting, considering my plight!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal=Your plight?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_6_Master_NPC=That I haven't taken to the skies in a long time!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_7_Master_NPC=It must have been a thousand years…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_8_Master_NPC=I am…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_9_Master_NPC=How weird, I can't recall my name…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_10_Master_NPC=Call me master.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_11_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Master of Conjuration!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_12_Master_NPC=Yes, yes yes ! The Master of Conjuration! Exactly!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_13_Crownbearer_Formal=Greetings, old friend!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_14_AnyButCrownbearer_Normal=Why do you call him that?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_15_Crownbearer_Normal=The Crown… told me to.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_16_Master_NPC=Ah, the Crown…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_17_Master_NPC=…thank you for coming to my rescue.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_18_Master_NPC=My mind was shattered since the Cataclysm.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_19_Master_NPC=The vanishing of mana left me broken.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_20_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal=Mana was gone?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_21_Master_NPC=Of course, after the closing of the Rift!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_22_Master_NPC=That's why I and my siblings were killed or crippled.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_23_Master_NPC=Kaseinax, and us, the masters, along with these deities…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_24_Master_NPC=…we poured everything we had to close and seal that Rift!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_25_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal=So the Cataclysm is… your fault?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_26_Master_NPC=It was the price to pay to stop the threat.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_27_Master_NPC=The Sorr-Akkath were and still are a menace to Solasta.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_28_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal=And so you took a gamble?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_29_Master_NPC=We were born to rule, not to grovel!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_30_Master_NPC=And we had sworn to protect our people!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_31_AnyNonElf_Normal=You mean your slaves?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_32_Master_NPC=Fool! Imperial rule brought order where there was only chaos!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_33_Master_NPC=But your empire was destroyed.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_34_AcademicianOrAcolyte_Normal=Who knows how many elves were killed?
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_35_Master_NPC=Ah! Because you believe that Manacalon was an elven empire!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_36_Master_NPC=Enough about the past!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_37_Master_NPC=Now I get that you want my gem.
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_38_Master_NPC=But even with his Crown, you're not my Magister!
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_39_Master_NPC=So, if you want it…
Narration/&ConjurationQuest_Master_40_Master_NPC=…you'll have to pry it from my dead claws!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_07=Kill them!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_08=Intruders!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_09=Don't let them get away!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_10=They're crazy!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_11=They'll kill us if we don't fight back!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_12=I stepped on some kind of magical rune. I guess there's a reason for that.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_13=Found one!
Narration/&Banter_ToM_14=Eh… nothing. Very funny.
Narration/&Banter_ToM_15=Another one, here.
Narration/&CaerLem_Nego23_Spy_Default=Alright, I'm opening it.
Narration/&Banter_SwitchToCautious=We should be careful.
Narration/&PriestOfArun1_Priest_NPC=Sun on your face, travelers!
Narration/&PriestOfArun2_Arun_Default=Balance and harmony, chaplain!
Narration/&PriestOfArun3_Priest_NPC=Fair weather, faithful one.
Narration/&PriestOfArun4_Priest_NPC=Good luck and fair weather!
Narration/&ChurchOfEinar_Dialog_01_16_DalonLark_NPC=Did you find any relics of interest in our fight against the Sorr-Akkath?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_01=Charming little town…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_02=Access to the canyon is blocked!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_03=You can't get to the other side - move on!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_04=You are not allowed to cross this bridge.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_01=Careful - I heard something!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_02=What were these goblins doing here?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_03=There must be some reason.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_04=Look - it works!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_05=It's something, isn't it?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_06=This is where they're coming from.
Narration/&Atima_Bladeburn_Goodbye=Just passing by.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_DalonLark01=Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HalmanSummer01=Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_HeddlonSurespell01=Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_JorielFoxeye01=Clear skies, citizens!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard01_03=Safe travels, adventurers!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_CityGuard02_03=Watch yourselves outside - the roads are not safe!
Narration/&Introduction_Stealth_LiamArrives=Liam! What are you doing here? I told you I'd take care of it!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel9_Default=Wait… Lisbath stayed back?
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel10_Default=She was broken.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel11_Default=They're gonna kill her!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel12_Default=If we go back for her, we die, too.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel13_Default=But… Fine… you're probably right.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_01=There's something strange about this place.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_02=I feel like someone's watching us.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_03=Looks kinda familiar, don't you think?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_04=It's too quiet!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_05=This is huge!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_06=Did you see that?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_07=A Defiler. It vanished!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_08=We should be careful. We're not alone.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_01=Master, I'm coming!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_01=I can see something in the water.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Loot_02=There's something under the ground.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_01=Friends are always welcome at the Shield!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_02=Peasants probably lived in these outbuildings.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_03=These walls seem to have been reinforced recently.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_04=Lore text
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_05=Lore Text
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_06=That elf looks so military in that garb, and those symbols on the tabard! It can only be Empress Cylloriel Wildspirit!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_07=Lore about the hall
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_01=It doesn't do anything. Maybe we're missing something.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_02=We've dealt with this before.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_PuzzleLight_03=We should come back at night.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_09=A spectacular place, isn't it?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_10=Are they… ghosts?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_11=What other wonders does this place contain?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_12=Let's stay on guard.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_02=We're close now, I can feel it.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_A=This magic goes far beyond our knowledge.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13_B=We can't go through here. It's too dangerous.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_09=Unbelievable, an intact copy of the History of the Elven Wars by the First Loremaster of the Arcaneum!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_10=This harp - look at the grain of this wood, the patina… it hasn't aged a day, seems anachronistic… And a 48-stringer!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_11=Knowing Manacalon, it could be anything! And I bet we don't have enough mana to make it work!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_07=It looks like a pattern that needs to be reproduced in some way…
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_08=This is a poem in elvish… about the moonlight?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Monastery_09=Maybe this only works at night!
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_19_Nope_Formal=We'll see what we can do.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Nope_WRITTEN=We can't promise anything.
Narration/&NecromancySubQuest101_18_Sure_WRITTEN=Sure, we'll do it.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_13=This magic goes far beyond our knowledge.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_14=We can't go through here. It's too dangerous.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_12=Laboratory. ENTRY STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_13=Library
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_14=Salon
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Kythaela_03=These projections are from the master, not ghosts.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_CoparannArrival_36_SellswordOrElse_Default=It was too late for him.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_Coparann_ PuzzleLight_Broken=This symbol is illegible. Perhaps we can find another one elsewhere?
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_15=The… projections, they're all gone.
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Environment_16=This must have something to do with Adrasteia's awakening.
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_4_Healer_Any_Normal=She doesn't have any wounds that I can see!
Narration/&AbjurationQuest_Razan_5_SarcasmOrElse_Normal=Well then, dazzle us and find out what's happening to her!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_15=By all the gods! Manacalon orchids! Clearly, they are correctly named!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_16="Principles of Architecture", by Karhelas Grayhand! He designed the Teansolais, the imperial palace of Siothyrnas!
Narration/&Banter_Abjuration_WizardTower_Observable_17=This is… Eiradir Fairmind, the justicar, as he presents the first codex of imperial law to the Court!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_01=Wait? Have you ever seen this kind of plant?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_02=The gem must be in this forest. One last effort and it will be ours.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_03=I knew it, we shouldn't have touched that sticky equipment.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_3_Arbal_NPC=Who your nyark friends?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_4_Arbal_NPC=Eh, nyark speaks! Kebra teach them?
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_10_Arbal_NPC=Before Arrok, Arbal would kill nyarks.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_13_Arbal_NPC=Not nice, no.
Narration/&CradleOfFire_Entrance_15_Orcishspeaker_Default=Ah! Thank you, nyark - that make my day.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_LavaRiver_04=It's too thick, we won't make it like this!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_01=What was that? Where are we?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_00=Go back to where you came from, you insignificant beings. You are not worthy to enter.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_01=I laugh at the emptiness of your actions.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Gate_02=Play the wise, you fools. Go ahead.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_DarkCave_1=Let's stay together. These caves are dark and full of terrors.
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_DarkCave_2=Do you remember where we come from?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Greed_1=It's too easy…
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_01=The gem, we found it!
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheClearing_02=Where are the Soraks?
Narration/&Banter_Conjuration_TheID_Beast_Observable_1=The gold just disappears in my hands!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_01=Edrof says gate closed for now.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_02=Bloodspear tribe is strong!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_03=Nyark go talk to Edrof. Only he give order to open passage.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Guard_04=Brok strong chief! He defeated Edrof.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_01=Kebra survived! Kebra strong.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_02=Nyark want to trade?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_03=Bloodspear strong tribe! Bloodspear plenty.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BloodSpear_Tribe_04=Nyarks friend with Brok. Brok strong chief!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_01=Nyarks go see Radulf!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_02=Radulf great Shaman.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_03=Nyark got mighty axe?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Guard_04=Nyarks have spider webs in hair.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_01=Brok new chief? Brok not dead?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_02=Nyarks need food?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_03=Bladefang best tribe. Bladefang got big shaman!
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Tribe_04=Kebra friend with nyarks?
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_01=Bring back the greataxe and I will consider an alliance.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_02=This sigil will unlock the door to my challenge.
Narration/&TextOnlyNPCSpeech_BladeFang_Radulf_03=No greataxe means we are not joining you.
Narration/&Tavern_02_41_Player_Default=Go easy on him. He's just a harmless, old drunk.
Narration/&Tavern_02_42_Player_Default=Probably saw lizardfolk, or dragonborn, or something…
Narration/&Tavern_02_43_Merton=You think I don't know the difference?
Narration/&Tavern_02_44_Merton=All those spines on their backs, those jaws - you've never seen anything like it!
Narration/&Tavern_02_45_Merton=Not lizardfolk, not troglodyte, not dragonborn. I'm telling you!
Narration/&Tavern_02_46_Player_Default=No one believes in Soraks anymore.
Narration/&Tavern_02_47_Player_Default=Except the Church of Einar, of course - there's a Sorak under every bed if you believe them.
Narration/&Tavern_02_48_Player_Default=Easy, now. Don't mock people for their faith.
Narration/&Tavern_02_49_Merton=Read them books. Soraks are masters of deception, infiltration…
Narration/&Tavern_02_50_Merton=…anyone here could be a Sorak, you'd never know.
Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Player_Default=Oh, come on!
Narration/&Tavern_02_51_Merton=You'll see.
Narration/&Tavern_02_52_Player_Default=Anyway…
Narration/&Tavern_01_2b_Explorer_Default=Is this the place for the Legacy Council job? Hope I'm not too late.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Choiceb=The Council's very new. How does it work, exactly?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran01b=Dear Maraike! You don't know?
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Player01b=Well, we know that each of the Eastern Kingdoms has a delegation…
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran02b=No - not the kingdoms. The Council is a neutral, academic body - in theory, at least.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran03b=It's true, though, that each delegation is from a different nation.
Narration/&Tavern_049_04_Council_Carran04b=Except for the Church of Einar. They are here to ensure fair dealings.
Narration/&Council01_70b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze=Our church has been warning of the Sorr-Akkath since humans first came to Solasta…
Narration/&Council01_71b_NPC_Einarium_Sunblaze=…in the wake of their foul god Sorr-Tarr!
Narration/&Council03_37b_Einarboss_NPC=Their foul god Sorr-Tarr knows. He is guiding them.
Narration/&Council03_37c_Einarboss_NPC=We tried to leave him - and them - behind on Tirmar. It seems we failed.
Narration/&Council03_41b_Antiquariansboss_NPC=Conjecture perhaps, but the evidence points in that direction.
Narration/&Council03_42b_Einarboss_NPC=Now they want the Crown. We may not know why, but we do know they must not have it!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_01=Yes… I understand.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_02=Who are you talking to? Wait - what are you doing?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_03=Are you crazy? Why did you put it on?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_04=We have no idea what it does, whether it's evil, or anything!
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_05=What? I… Oh. I… It… I just… kind of… had to.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_06=We're supposed to share the loot, by the way.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFindingTheCrown_TakeCrown_08=Forget it, let's get out of here.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_39b_Fighter_Default=Are they all undead in there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_41_Default=Undead? What other abominations are in there?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_42_Default=Undead? What types? Are they free or enslaved?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_43_Default=Undead? That's not good. And you deal with them?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest01_44_Default=Undead. I might have known. Anything goes out here, it seems.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_06b_Intimidate_Default=There's nowhere in the world where necromancy isn't a crime.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37b_Player=A defiler? A blood-drinking Child of Sorrow?
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_37c_Player=Twice-cursed defilers! They are the worst of the undead!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_44_Player=Stay in the light! It is our only protection.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest04_45_Player=Maraike will protect us. Her powers are strong against these abominations.
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11b_Kill_Default=Abomination! The light of Einar will destroy you!
Narration/&NecromancyQuest05_11c_Kill_Default=Twice-cursed monster! Prepare to die - again!
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4b_Cynicism_Default=Right out of a fairytale, as ugly as life.
Narration/&CaerLem_InTunnel4c_Cynicism_Default=And certainly not lizardfolk.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21b_Player=So - big, walking lizards with spikes all over their backs?
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21c_Player=Except for the one who looked just like your Captain, of course.
Narration/&CaerLem_Darik21d_Player=Was he one of them all along, do you think?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_4b_History_Default=Doesn't have the big spines…
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_10_Default=It's standing just like a human. Ever seen a dragon do that?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_11_Default=Ever seen a dragon at all? How would you know?
Narration/&TowerOfMagicStatueDraconic_12_Default=Stop losing time, it's just a statue.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_01=Look at this place! I've never seen so many books!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_02=It would take a lifetime to read them all! Even for an elf!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_03=Must be worth a fortune! If only we could get everything back to Caer Cyflen…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_04=I see the point of the Scavengers now…
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_05=Why not keep this to ourselves?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_01=Crap! The book just turned into dust!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_02=Damn! This book is… not really here!
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_03=Do you mean all this fortune is out of reach?
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_04=The library is trapped within this… magical phenomenon.
Narration/&TowerOfMagic_Discovery_Banter_05=I should have known… it was too good to be true.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_22_Religion_Default=That's an old Tirmarian symbol. It stands for Arivad.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_23_Religion_Default=He was a Tirmarian god, but he didn't come to Solasta.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_24_Religion_Default=I can't remember much more.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_25_Einar_Default="A" stands for Arivad - an evil god from old Tirmar. I read about him.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_26_Einar_Default=The Soraks call him Sorr-Tarr. "Sorr-Akkath" means "beloved of Sorr-Tarr" in their tongue.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_27_Lowlife_Default=I've heard whispers of cultists with an "A" tattoo.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_28_Lowlife_Default=There's a name, too: "Arivad."
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_29_Default=These humans are Arivad cultists, in league with the Soraks.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_30_Default=We better be careful.
Narration/&TowerOfMagicFight1over_31_Default=And don't forget, we need the head of a Sorak.
Narration/&InTemple_1_Crowbearer_Default=Lord Sunblaze - thank you for you hospitality.
Narration/&InTemple_2_EinarBoss_NPC=It's the least we can do for the deputies who proved that there are still Soraks on Solasta.
Narration/&InTemple_3_EinarBoss_NPC=You've proved we cannot relax our vigilance.
Narration/&InTemple_4_EinarBoss_NPC=Did you find anything else that could help us track them?
Narration/&InTemple_5_EinarBoss_NPC=There was a parchment.
Narration/&InTemple_6_EinarBoss_NPC=If you find it, send for the Tshar.
Narration/&InTemple_7_Curious_NPC=You can read that?
Narration/&InTemple_8_EinarBoss_NPC=That last word, it's not Tirmarian… it's in the Sorr-Akkath tongue.
Narration/&InTemple_9_Selfpres_NPC=I knew it!
Narration/&InTemple_10_EinarBoss_NPC=It means "general."
Narration/&InTemple_11_EinarBoss_NPC=You were wise to run.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_1_Player_Default=Also, the fanatics we fought near that old tower…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_2_Player_Default=…they all had this tattoo on their arm.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_3_Player_Default=And we found this letter.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_4_Player_Default=It seems to support the idea that they were working for the Soraks under duress.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_5_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=It is indeed one of their ways.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_6_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Now this, is the A of Arivad.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_7_Player_Default=Can you enlighten us?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_8_Player_Default=Between the myth and what we've seen, it's confusing.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_9_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Of course.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_10_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=We paladins and clerics of Einar are the guardians of these memories.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_11_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Our ancestors fought the war against the Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_12_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Their god, Sorr-Tarr, gave them dark powers of treachery, mind reading, and shapechanging.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_13_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=They infiltrated the human society, corrupted the hearts of men.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_14_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=At some point, everyone was suspected to be a Sorak in disguise.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_15_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Distrust broke humanity. Sorr-Tarr had won.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_16_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=He corrupted even Arivad, god of the inquisitors.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_17_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=The gods themselves decided to run away from Tirmar.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_18_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=They opened the rift for the humans to escape, to Solasta.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_19_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Many of them didn't make it. It was a tragedy.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_20_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=At the site of the rift, thousands of Soraks tried to cross.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_21_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Sorr-Tarr himself tried.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_22_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=The rift was closed, in a gigantic blast.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_23_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Our kings and heroes, Manacalon's masters of magic, were all wiped out.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_24_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=So, how could Soraks have survived, escaped and then thrived on Solasta?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_25_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=I supposed that's another one of their tricks.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_26_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=But for those who had survived the war, the exodus…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_27_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=…it was paramount to stay vigilant, to keep the memory alive.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_28_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=The memory of what Soraks were, what they could do.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_29_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=So that, if one day, they were to return.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_30_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=We'd be ready.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_31_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=I'm sorry to say, after a thousand years, only few of us remain.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_32_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Most people believe Soraks are a mere legend, now.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_33_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=But you brought us proof.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_34_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=The Soraks are not extinct.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_35_NO_AUDIO=Are there different Soraks?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_36_Player_Default=We fought different ones, do you know more?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_37_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=The bulk of their army are foot soldiers, with poisoned spines.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_38_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=They breed a cast of albino priests, able to cast spells.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_39_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Some of them are deadly assassins - invisible, venomous.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_40_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Others are giant brutes.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_41_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=The scriptures talk of elite warriors, anti-paladins.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_42_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=The Shikkath.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_43_NO_AUDIO=Can they mimic people?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_44_Player_Default=Can they really impersonate people?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_45_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=It's been proven, though it's a long process.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_46_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=They used to kidnap a target, study it for weeks, sometimes months.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_47_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=One of their chosen ones would transform into a perfect duplicate.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_48_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=Upon death, they would return to their original form.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_49_NO_AUDIO=Why do people follow them?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_50_Player_Default=How do they get people to worship them?
Narration/&InTemple_Added_51_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=They get into people's minds…
Narration/&InTemple_Added_52_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=…learn their darkest secrets, their fears, their shameful desires.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_53_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=With that, they can blackmail, corrupt, and finally recruit.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_54_Beric_AkilWingate_NPC=It's much easier for them than to duplicate, and very efficient.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_55_Player_Default=Well, that's all very scary, but thanks, it's going to help us.
Narration/&InTemple_Added_56_Player_Default=You're welcome, deputies.
Narration/&InTemple_12_EinarBoss_NPC=If you find anything else connected to the Sorr-Akkath or their allies, bring it to the Temple.
Narration/&InTemple_13_EinarBoss_NPC=Talk to Chaplain Dalon Lark. You will be well rewarded.
Narration/&InTemple_14_EinarBoss_NPC=Whenever you're ready, the Council will meet again.
Narration/&Council02_Final1_Gormdsottir_NPC=Deputies!
Narration/&Council02_Final2_Gormdsottir_NPC=Your report speaks of a library in a tower of magic?
Narration/&Council02_Final3_Any_Default=Yes, madam.
Narration/&Council02_Final4_Gormdsottir_NPC=That is incredible! Do you realize the historical value?
Narration/&Council02_Final5_Any_Default=Well, all these books are either floating above a chasm or… disappear on touch.
Narration/&Council02_Final6_Gormdsottir_NPC=What? So all this knowledge is not accessible?
Narration/&Council02_Final7_Any_Default=It's going to take a lot of time to check the place entirely.
Narration/&Council02_Final8_Any_Default=And it may not be totally safe.
Narration/&Council02_Final9_Any_Default=Scavengers are going to establish an outpost, I suppose.
Narration/&Council02_Final10_Gormdsottir_NPC=This is an incredible finding, deputies. Thanks for your service.
Narration/&Council02_Final11_Any_Default=You're welcome.
Narration/&Council02_Final12_Any_Formal=Chancellor.
Narration/&Exposition1_Beric_NPC=Four new members, all recommended by trusted citizens.
Narration/&Exposition2_Gormsdottir_NPC=We should deputize them right away.
Narration/&Exposition3_Beric_NPC=They will be pretty green. Let's wait for Captain Merran to return.
Narration/&Exposition4_Gormsdottir_NPC=We can't wait. Three weeks without any news?
Narration/&Exposition5_Gormsdottir_NPC=Everybody in Caer Lem might be dead already.
Narration/&Exposition6_Gormsdottir_NPC=Lord Stonebeard is eager to send troops to rescue his daughter.
Narration/&Exposition7_Beric_NPC=Only Council forces may enter the Badlands! Otherwise, the treaty is broken, and it's war.
Narration/&Exposition8_Gormsdottir_NPC=That's why we need to hire more Council deputies, even if they're not tested!
Narration/&Exposition9_Gormsdottir_NPC=Way too many people are waiting for the Council to fail!
Narration/&Exposition10_Gormsdottir_NPC=Oh, look, the Legacy Council doesn't work! Nobody wants to join it!
Narration/&Exposition11_Gormsdottir_NPC=Let's invade the principality and take the Badlands' treasures first!
Narration/&Exposition12_Beric_NPC=I know. The Council must hold.
Narration/&Exposition13_Beric_NPC=Let's get our new deputies to work.
Narration/&CarranTalk_1_Carran_NPC=Lord Carran, we'd like to ask you a few questions.
Narration/&CarranTalk_2_Player_Default=Again?
Narration/&CarranTalk_3_Carran_NPC=Well, I'm here at your service, deputies.
Narration/&CarranTalk_4_WRITTEN_A=Ask for details about the geography.
Narration/&CarranTalk_5_WRITTEN_A1=Ask for details about the Principality.
Narration/&CarranTalk_6_WRITTEN_A2=Ask for details about the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_7_WRITTEN_A3=Ask for details about the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&CarranTalk_8_WRITTEN_B=Ask for details about the politics.
Narration/&CarranTalk_9_WRITTEN_B1=Ask for details about the Council.
Narration/&CarranTalk_10_WRITTEN_B2=Ask for details about the factions.
Narration/&CarranTalk_11_WRITTEN_B3=Ask for details about the Scavengers.
Narration/&CarranTalk_12_WRITTEN_ChangeTopics=Change the general topic.
Narration/&CarranTalk_13_Player_Default=Can you explain again the Legacy Council's purpose?
Narration/&CarranTalk_14_Carran_NPC=Really? Right.
Narration/&CarranTalk_15_Carran_NPC=The position of the Copperhead Road puts the Principality in a strategic position…
Narration/&CarranTalk_16_Carran_NPC=…to exploit the ancient knowledge and treasures that come out of the Badlands.
Narration/&CarranTalk_17_Carran_NPC=The Council makes sure everyone has equal access, so no one's tempted to invade.
Narration/&CarranTalk_19_Player_Default=Why are you recruiting adventurers?
Narration/&CarranTalk_18_Carran_NPC=To scout the Badlands and the Marches that surround them…
Narration/&CarranTalk_20_Carran_NPC=…and bring back whatever can be recovered. Antiquities, magical lore, anything.
Narration/&CarranTalk_21_Carran_NPC=Then the Council makes sure everyone gets a chance to study it.
Narration/&CarranTalk_22_Carran_NPC=We want people who will swear allegiance to the Council, and not to one nation.

Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_16_Crier_Quest=Oyez! Oyez! Our Lord Protector wishes to reminds you all, that fighting in the streets of his capital is strictly prohibited! Those who contravene the law will be punished!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Cage_01=I think that prisoner's been dead for a while.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Cage_02=What kind of warning is that? This is crazy!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Cage_03=I think this poor fellow died some time ago…
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Cage_04=This cage isn't very comfortable…
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Cage_05=Well, then - let's try not to anger this town's ruler.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Cage_06=Imprisoned in a cage outside. Not the best way to spend your time…
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Cage_07=Oh, joy - public disgrace and torture. Definitely not a good sign!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Marin_01=Take this key. The second key is close by - near the waterfall, so I've heard.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Marin_02=Open the stone gate. I'll meet you inside.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Marin_03=Find the temple. I'll wait for you here.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_1_Citizena_A1=Shhh… the guards will hear you.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_2_Citizenb_A2=I don't care, we can't go on like this! Someone has to say something.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_3_Citizena_A3=I'm not going to jail with you!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_4_Citizena_B1=My son was at Feleg outpost - they were attacked!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_5_Citizenb_B2=Oh, how is he?
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_6_Citizena_B3=Rotting in jail. He surrendered instead of dying for the Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_7_Citizena_C1=I heard about something called the Mask. Do you know what it is?
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_8_Citizenb_C2=Some guild of thieves, I think.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_9_Citizena_C3=I thought it was a gambling den - something off the books.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_10_Citizena_D1=Why the long face?
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_11_Citizenb_D2=The guard took my food stocks.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_12_Citizenb_D3=They said there was a banquet at the palace.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_13_Citizena_D4=Well, of course. Just like every other day.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_14_Citizen_E=No, I don't want to know what you think. Thinking's dangerous these days, and talking's even worse!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_15_Citizen_F=Soon there won't be anyone left! He'll execute every last one of us!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_16_Citizen_G=I know the Lord Protector keeps us safe, but… No! I didn't say but! I'm loyal!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_17_Citizen_H=That crook Torrik swindled me. I've a good mind to denounce him as a traitor!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_18_Citizen_I=I love the Lord Protector, do you hear me? I love him! Now leave me alone!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_19_Citizen_J=How long can we go on like this? It's impossible!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_20_Citizen_K=It just gets worse and worse. Innocence counts for nothing any more!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_21_Citizen_L=When he's killed everyone - then what? It's insane!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_22_Citizen_M=The guard is completely out of control!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_23_Citizen_N=Doesn't matter who's in charge - it's always the people who suffer.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_24_Citizen_O=I don't care who's in the palace, as long as they stay there and leave us all alone!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_25_Citizen_P=Things got worse recently. Like someone's trying to stir up trouble.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_26_Citizen_Q=They took my mother - an old woman! I'll never see her again.!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_27_Citizen_R=The guy rotting in the cage down there? I knew him as a child.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_28_Citizen_S=Poor bastard mispronounced the name of the Lord Protector…now he's dead, I swear!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_29_Citizen_T=Brogarad is the worst. Her heart is cold as ice. I think she actually likes to kill people.
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_30_Citizen_U=I heard Hannik was brought to the Lord Protector…seditious words in his last song!
Narration/&DLC1_Hyfryd_31_Citizen_U=He improvised a joke about the Anfarels. That probably saved his neck!
Narration/&Player_Banter_Background_Quest_Wanderer_01=Look! This must be the bandits' hideout!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer1_Auroc_NPC=You look just like your father!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer2_Wanderer_Default=Auroc? Is that really you?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer3_Auroc_NPC=Who else would it be?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer4_Auroc_NPC=And you - you were just a kid the last time I saw you!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer5_Auroc_NPC=And when I came back, well…
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer6_Auroc_NPC=…the village was in ruins.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer7_Auroc_NPC=I thought you were dead. Then I heard you were in Coparann.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer8_Wanderer_Default=I was away, too. Otherwise I'd be dead like all the others.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer9_Auroc_NPC=That was lucky. Now…
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer10_Auroc_NPC=…do you want to avenge them?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer11_Auroc_NPC=I slept in the charred ruins of the village as I buried my people.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer12_Auroc_NPC=There were marks on the bodies - marks made by weapons, not by claws or teeth!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer13_Auroc_NPC=So I realized that those monsters…were just bandits…
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer14_Wanderer_Default=You mean…
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer15_Auroc_NPC=Yes, kid. They're just bandits - and I found them.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer16_Wanderer_Default=What are we waiting for?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer17_Auroc_NPC=Easy, now! I'll tell you!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer18_Auroc_NPC=I tracked them to one of the elf ruins in the mountains.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer19_Auroc_NPC=There were too many of them, so I sealed them in with a rockfall.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer20_Wanderer_Default=So, what - we just wait for them to die?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer21_Auroc_NPC=No. They might find a way out, or someone might help them.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer22_Auroc_NPC=I know their hideout connects to Coparann's old mines.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer23_Auroc_NPC=They're trapped somewhere in there.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer24_Auroc_NPC=I asked the Ceannard to let you enter the mines.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer25_Auroc_NPC=And me along with you.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer26_Wanderer_Default=All right - let's go!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer27_Auroc_NPC=Good! Meet me in front of the mine!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End1_Larson_NPC=You have my Thanks, adventurers!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End2_Wanderer_Default=What for?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End3_Larson_NPC=For getting rid of those undead…
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End4_Larson_NPC=…not to mention the redeemers!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End5_Larson_NPC=Thanks to you, we can leave now and find another way out…
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End6_Wanderer_Default=You were never trapped by a landslide?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End7_Auroc_NPC=Of course not!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End8_Wanderer_Default=Auroc!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End9_Auroc_NPC=Well…
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End10_Auroc_NPC=I wanted revenge, yes - but not for the burned village.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End11_Larson_NPC=Wait - revenge against me?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End12_Auroc_NPC=Of course!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End13_Auroc_NPC=Your mother - she rejected me!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End14_Auroc_NPC=Your father - he banished me from the village, he humiliated me.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End15_Auroc_NPC=I swore they'd pay for that!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End16_Larson_NPC=Did you think Auroc was really out for revenge?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End17_Larson_NPC=Well, he was - just not against us.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End18_Wanderer_Default=Me?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End19_Larson_NPC=You don't even know why your father banished him.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End20_Larson_NPC=He fell in love with your mother. Ha!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End21_Larson_NPC=Your old man couldn't take it, so Auroc had to go.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End22_Larson_NPC=Not that your sweet mommy would let an half-orc into her bed, I'm sure.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End23_Wanderer_Default=I had… no idea.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End24_Wanderer_Default=But you did burn down my village - right?
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End25_Larson_NPC=For a very paltry bit of loot - but yes, I confess…
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_End26_Larson_NPC=You'll die for that!
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_Conclusion1_Partner_Cynical=That was…awkward.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_Conclusion2_Partner_Friendly=I'm sorry.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_Conclusion3_Partner_Lawful=So much for friendship.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_Conclusion4_Partner_Slanglish=That Auroc - what a jerk.
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_Conclusion5_Wanderer_Default=It was a long time ago, but…
Narration/&Background_Quest_Wanderer_Conclusion6_Wanderer_Default=…I guess it's some kind of closure.
Narration/&New_Player_Banters1_Normal_Hello=Hello.
Narration/&New_Player_Banters2_Normal_Hello=Clear skies!
Narration/&New_Player_Banters3_Normal_Hello=Clear skies, friend.

Narration/&New_Player_Banters49_Normal_Noted2=We'll keep that in mind.
Narration/&New_Player_Banters50_Normal_SorryNo=Sorry, no.
Narration/&New_Player_Banters51_Normal_SorryNo2=We can't do that.
Narration/&New_Player_Banters52_Normal_BuggerOff1=Get lost!

Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Marches_01=Is that Coparann I see over there?
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Marches_02=This is all falling apart. Let's take a souvenir.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Marches_03=Looks Manacalon but…not.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Marches_06=This looks familiar.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Marches_04=Watch your step!
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Marches_05=Did we just walk into a trap?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_1_Starter_Default=Does this happen often?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_2_Starter_Default=Wounded strangers setting up camp near the caravan?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_3_Galar_NPC=Oh, yes. These sites are well known to all who travel in the Marches.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_4_Galar_NPC=Sadly, they're not here for shopping.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_5_Partner_Default=Do you know them?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_6_Galar_NPC=Well, the lady is from the Legacy Council, in Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_7_Galar_NPC=They're looking for someone.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_8_Galar_NPC=Apparently they were ten strong - then they met a bunch of orcs.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_9_Galar_NPC=I'm sure the lady can tell you more.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_10_Reactor_Default=Why don't you do it?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_11_Reactor_Default=Okay, you're the boss.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_12_Galar_NPC=It's a strategy.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_13_Galar_NPC=You'll see.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_14_Partner_Default=Fine.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_15_Galar_NPC=The man here is Lord Hammond, also from the capital.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS01_16_Galar_NPC=I spoke with the half-elf briefly. Her name is Leyrin Catpaw.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_1_HeliaFairblade_NPC=What do you want?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_2_Starter_Default=Just introducing ourselves.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_3_HeliaFairblade_NPC=I'm Helia Fairblade, Senior Deputy of the Legacy Council.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_4_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Please buy some equipment.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_5_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Who are you looking for?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_6_Partner_Default=Do you need equipment? Master Galar has everything you need.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_7_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Do you think we came here empty handed?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_8_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA1=No.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB1=You never know.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_10_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC1_Philosopher=Philosophical answer.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_11_ChoiceA1_Default=I guess not.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_12_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Good guess.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_13_ChoiceB1_Fail=We're good, Thank you.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_14_ChoiceB1_Success=Fine - I'll check out the store.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_15_ChoiceC1_Philosopher_Default=You probably believe you have everything under control.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_16_ChoiceC1_Philosopher_Default=But how can you be sure that you won't find a rare component?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_17_ChoiceC1_Philosopher_Default=Or some other unexpected treasure?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_18_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Well, of course, I can take a look.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_19_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Anything else?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_20_HeliaFairblade_NPC=A man called Marin Ving. He was presumed to be dead.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_21_HeliaFairblade_NPC=But recently, Coparann opened a diplomatic channel with Caer Cyflen.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_22_HeliaFairblade_NPC=We heard that Ving was here recently, buying food rations from master Goldentongue.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_23_Starter_Default=Who is he?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_24_HeliaFairblade_NPC=I'm not at liberty to say more. My apologies.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Understood.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_26_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB_Spy=He's in trouble.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_27_Spy_Default=This search party isn't looking for a friend to save, right?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_28_HeliaFairblade_NPC=He carried…documents the Council values.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_29_Spy_Default=What if we were to find them?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_30_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Then you'd be rewarded.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_31_Starter_Default=Who's the man you're looking for?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_NPC2_FirstVisit_32_Starter_Default=No but you might miss one or two things that are going to make a difference.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary0_Mercenary_NPC=Hi there. Name's Krim Sunsail.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary1_Mercenary_NPC=You're working for the merchant? Escort?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary2_Starter_Default=Yes.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary3_Mercenary_NPC=The Marches are a good place to gain some experience…
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary4_Mercenary_NPC=…or to get killed.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary5_Partner_Default=Well, you're here.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary6_Mercenary_NPC=Sure. There's money to be made.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary7_Mercenary_NPC=A debt to collect from this guy, Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary8_Commentator_Default=What if he's dead?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary9_Mercenary_NPC=We'll see.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary10_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA_Lowlife=You know something.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary11_Lowlife_Default=There's more about him.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary12_Mercenary_NPC=Aaah, am I so easy to read?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary13_Lowlife_Default=Can't fool me, brother.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary14_Mercenary_NPC=He has a diamond instead of a tooth, I hear.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary15_Mercenary_NPC=Not easy to see, in the back of the mouth.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary16_Lowlife_Default=So even if he's dead, there's money to make?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary17_Mercenary_NPC=Yep.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary18_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB_Sellsword=Let's join forces.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary19_Sellsword_Default=We should team up.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary20_Mercenary_NPC=Maybe tomorrow. Right now, I've got wounds to tend to.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary21_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Need some equipment?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary22_Starter_Default=Well, Galar has some good stuff, wanna check?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary23_Mercenary_NPC=Naah, I'm good.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary24_Mercenary_NPC=Sure, why not?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Tell us about Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary26_Mercenary_NPC=What do you know about Ving?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary27_Mercenary_NPC=Dunno, really. Heard stories.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary28_Mercenary_NPC=Elusive guy.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary29_Mercenary_NPC=He's got debts, enemies…
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS02_Mercenary30_Mercenary_NPC=…but everybody wants him alive.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_1_Noble_NPC=What is it?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_2_Starter_Default=Anything you need from the store?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_3_Noble_NPC=I'm not here to shop!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_4_Starter_Default=Then what are you here for?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_5_Noble_NPC=Looking for this damn Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_6_Noble_NPC=He was here - you may have seen him.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_7_Partner_Default=We're new, so probably not.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_8_Noble_NPC=Well, he's a ruffian, and he has a debt of honor.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA_Aristocrat=Honor is important.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_10_Aristocrat_Default=Well, if it's a question of honor, he needs to be found.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_11_Noble_NPC=Absolutely!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_12_Noble_NPC=I'm happy to see that this word still means something in this forsaken place.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_13_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB_ Lawkeeper=He's wanted?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_14_Lawkeeper_Default=Is he wanted by the law?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_15_Noble_NPC=Not by the Principality's law.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_16_Noble_NPC=But in the Duchy of Northern plains, he certainly is.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_17_Lawkeeper_Default=Well in that case, our duty is clear.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_18_Lawkeeper_Default=You can count on us, sir.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_19_Noble_NPC=Thank you.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_20_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=We'll find him.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_21_Starter_Default=Very well - we will find him, never fear.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_22_Noble_NPC=I have no doubt.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS03_Noble_23_Noble_Angry=You dare to speak to me after what you did?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_1_Rogue_NPC=Don't even try to sell me your stuff!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_2_Starter_Default=Why not?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_3_Rogue_NPC=I know Galar is jacking his prices up because we're on the road.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_4_Starter_Default=You're in the business?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_5_Rogue_NPC=No…I joined the party hoping to find some historical treasures.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_6_NOAUDIO_Academic=There are some around here
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_7_Academic_Default=Oh, this place is full of history.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_8_Rogue_NPC=Right? Have you seen anything?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_9_Academic_Default=I'm pretty sure if we get off the road, we'll find some antiques.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_10_Rogue_NPC=Well if you do, I might be interested in buying.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_11_NOAUDIO_Acolyte=Do you pray to Misaye?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_12_Acolyte_Default=Is that a lady of luck tattoo you've got there?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_13_Rogue_NPC=Just a mercenary thing.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_14_Acolyte_Default=There's no shame in faith.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_15_Rogue_NPC=Are you done?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_16_Acolyte_Default=Scholars and academics rarely worship the goddess of mischief, that's all.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_17_Rogue_NPC=I wasn't always a scholar.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_18_Rogue_NPC=Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_19_Acolyte_Default=You mean, you can fight, then?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_20_Rogue_NPC=Better than the other six who died on the way here.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_21_Rogue_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_22_NOAUDIO_Defaulter=Instead, you almost got killed.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_23_Any_Default=Instead, you were attacked by orcs.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_24_Rogue_NPC=As you can see, I'm still standing.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_25_NOAUDIO_Deception=You'll get a discount.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_26_Deceiver_Default=Actually, Galar offers a discount for Council agents.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_27_Rogue_NPC=Really? Fine, I'll check out the wares.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS04_Rogue_28_Rogue_NPC=Lowering the inflated prices to the regular prices? No, Thanks!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_1_Galar_NPC=Ah, you're here.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_2_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Master Goldentongue tells me you're good people.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_3_HeliaFairblade_NPC=As you've heard, my expediton is short-handed.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_4_Starter_Default=Lost six, we heard.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_5_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Unfortunate.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_6_HeliaFairblade_NPC=If you join my search party, I'll pay well.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_7_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Five gold pieces a day, each.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_8_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Twenty-five up front.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_9_HeliaFairblade_NPC=I need Marin Ving found, and we know he was here.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_10_HeliaFairblade_NPC=It was a while ago, but if we're careful we can pick up his tracks.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_11_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=All right.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_12_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Thirty up front
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_13_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Equipment instead of gold
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_14_ChoiceA_Default=We have a deal!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_15_ChoiceB_Default=Let's settle for thirty-five gold pieces right now.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_16_ChoiceC_Default=Gold is no use to us here. We need better equipment.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_17_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Excellent!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_18_HeliaFairblade_NPC=I moved the barrier.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_19_HeliaFairblade_NPC=I believe this is a good place to start.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_20_HeliaFairblade_NPC=I see Galar taught you well.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_21_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Fine - thirty-five.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_22_Starter_Default=Thanks!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_23_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Thirty - last chance!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_24_HeliaFairblade_NPC=I don't have much, but our fallen comrades had some things.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Two healing potions
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_26_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Dust of disappearance
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_27_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Basic poison
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_28_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Take the gold
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_29_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Considering your actions…I have my doubts.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_30_HeliaFairblade_NPC=But right now, I don't have much choice.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS011_Starter_Default=Look at this!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS012_Partner_Default=Someone built a fire here.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS013_Reactor_Default=That someone wanted to rest here, but had to leave in a hurry.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Grotto_CS014_Commentator_Default=Did you hear that?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook1_HeliaFairblade_NPC=So, what do you have for me?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook2_Starter_Angry=We found an abandoned camp.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook3_Starter_Angry=And this.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook4_HeliaFairblade_NPC=This belongs to Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook5_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Excellent work!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook6_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Rest now. We'll search the area carefully in the morning.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook7_HeliaFairblade_NPC=We need to know where he went.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook8_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Team up with my people if you like.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook9_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Master Goldentongue wants to talk to you, by the way.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook10_HeliaFairblade_NPC=I advise you to make amends.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook11_Mean_Slang=Forget it!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook12_Anyother_Normal=We don't need a lecture.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS07_FoundBook13_HeliaFairblade_NPC=Your reward, as promised.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest1_Rogue_NPC=Looks like you brought me some.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest2_Starter_Default=Multiple items, actually, they seem connected.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest3_Rogue_NPC=By all the gods…
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest4_Rogue_NPC=Thanks a lot - this makes my day!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS08_CompleteRogueQuest5_Rogue_NPC=Here - take this. I have no use for it, but maybe you will…
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_1_Player_Default=Wait…redeemers?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_2_Player_Default=We don't stand a chance!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_3_Player_Default=Maybe we can find a way around and return to the camp.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_4_Player_Default=This place is a…nest, or something.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_5_Player_Default=We can't go back.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_6_Player_Default=Looks like the same thing happened to our friend Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Trapped_7_Player_Default=There's no choice - we have to move forward.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_Basic=Yes, yes - I'll check your wares.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_Waiting=Anything new?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_QuestDone=You did well!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_HeliaFairblade_Angry=There is only one rule : don't get caught.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Basic=Sorry - I really have to catch my breath.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Waiting=Tell me if you find anything of interest.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Happy=Those were some nice artifacts you brought me.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Basic=Those orcs almost killed us all.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Waiting=I'm sharpening my blade.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Angry=Where I come from, we cut the hands off thieves.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Basic=Speak to Lady Fairblade, I'm resting.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Waiting=Find me Ving and I'll reward you.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Angry=I knew you were just scum.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Galar_Angry=I can't have thieves working for me.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Noble_Recruit=If you're after Marin Ving, I'm with you.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Mercenary_Recruit=Sure, let's do this!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_NPC_Banter_Rogue_Recruit=Why not? I'll tag along.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions1_WRITTEN_ChoiceA=Ask companions to stay
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions2_WRITTEN_ChoiceB=Never mind.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions3_ChoiceA_Default=We'd like to continue on our own for now.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_GiveUpCompanions4_ChoiceB_Default=It's nothing, sorry.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_1_Starter_Default=We're out!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_2_Partner_Default=This place is a redeemer's nest!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_3_Reactor_Default=How are we going to get back to the camp?
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_4_Commentator_Default=We can't!
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_5_Starter_Default=On the other hand…I think Marin Ving went this way, too.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_Valley_Exit_6_Starter_Default=See?
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_01=Could be one of Ving's escorts.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_02=I think we're on the right track.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_03=Look - more tracks!
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_04=Wow! This gate is massive!
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_05=We might need some kind of magical key to open it.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_06=There are empty spaces here - for something beetle-shaped?
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_07=This beetle item seems to fit in the slot.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_08=I guess we need another one…
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_09=Look, it's working !
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_10=I don't see a lock to pick.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_11=How are we gonna open that ?
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_12=We need to move this rock if we want to get in.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_13=This rock is blocking the way into the grotto.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_14=Well, another bodyguard bites the dust…
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_15=Look - treehouses! Fancy!
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_16=Marin Ving either got off this plateau or his corpse is feeding those crows.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Valley_17=Let's look around. He may still be around here, wounded or something.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_TracksBanter01=That's a bunch of footprints - more than just one man.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_TracksBanter02=More footprints.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_TracksBanter03=I think that's just two people, now.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_TracksBanter04=Now there's just one set of tracks. Looks like all the others didn't make it this far.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_1_Rose_NPC=New in town, eh?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_5_Rose_NPC=I'm Rose.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_6_Rose_NPC=Just so you know, the law is a little strict 'round here.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_7_Any_Cynical=Beggars are still allowed, it seems.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_8_Rose_NPC=Ha, ha.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_9_Any_Lawful=Meaning what, exactly?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_10_Rose_NPC=The people in here stick together, if you catch my drift…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_11_Rose_NPC=…so, if you need any advice…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_12_Any_Friendly=You're the "go-to" person?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_13_Rose_NPC=Sure am.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_15_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Goodbye.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_16_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=What about the law?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_17_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=What do you do?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_18_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Tell us about the city.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_20_Any_ChoiceB=What's there to know about the law?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_21_Rose_NPC=The lord protector, Orenetis, he's… kind of strict.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_22_Rose_NPC=You should go to the palace and introduce yourself.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_23_Rose_NPC=Just so no one mistakes you for…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_24_Rose_NPC=…I don't know…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_25_Rose_NPC=…rebels.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_26_Any_Default=There are rebels?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_27_Rose_NPC=So I hear.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_28_Rose_NPC=Never met any.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_30_Any_ChoiceC=So, what do you do here?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_31_Rose_NPC=Me? Oh, I'm just a simple citizen…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_32_Rose_NPC=…doing my best to help my community.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_33_Rose_NPC=Welcome, strangers!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_34_Any_Pragmatic=Ever heard of a stranger called Marin Ving?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_35_Rose_NPC=No - doesn't ring a bell.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_36_Any_ChoiceD=What can you tell us about the city?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_37_Rose_NPC=It's the capital of the Dominion, Caer Hyfryd…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_38_Rose_NPC=…ruled by our Lord Protector, Orenetis himself.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_39_Rose_NPC=Mostly populated by nobles, merchants, and craftsmen…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_40_Rose_NPC=…along with some wealthy farmers and breeders.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_41_Rose_NPC=You're in the low city. There's a high city, and the palace.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_42_Rose_NPC=You can sleep at the Merry Remorhaz. The owner is a friend.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_44_Druid_Default=What's your friend's name?

Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_12_Henrik_NPC=I buy from people in the valley - farmers and breeders.

Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_14_Any_ChoiceB=We're looking for a human called Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_15_Henrik_NPC=That's a strange name. Another stranger, I guess?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_18_Henrik_NPC=Sorry, never heard of him.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_19_Henrik_ChoiceC=How do you like it here?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_20_Henrik_NPC=The city? Well, we're safe from the monsters.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_21_Player_NPC=How about your government?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_22_Henrik_NPC=The Lord Protector? He's all right.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_27_Henrik_NPC=Just one thing, if you don't mind.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_28_Henrik_NPC=I'm looking for some rare meat.

Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_11_Malariel_NPC=You're lucky that some of you at least, are of the superior race.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_12_Any_History=Did we go back in time to the Manacalon era?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_13_Any_History=Because I don't like to be insulted.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_14_Any_Dwarf=And I have no desire to be enslaved.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_15_Any_Formal=For the time being, we should…restrain our outrage.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_16_Any_Formal=Especially if this Orenetis is a powerful Manacalon lord.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_17_Orenetis_NPC=Ah…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_18_Orenetis_NPC=It's been a long time since we've had visitors from…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_19_Orenetis_NPC=…foreign parts.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_20_Any_Default=We got lost.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_21_Malariel_NPC=Do not speak without being told to!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_22_Orenetis_NPC=It's all right, Malariel…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_23_Orenetis_NPC=…our guests here are from a different…culture.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_24_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=We came to pay our respects.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Who do you think you are?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_26_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Tell her to shut up!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_27_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Accept our apologies.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_28_Any_ChoiceA=We came to introduce ourselves…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_29_Any_Default=…we don't really know how things work around here.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_30_Any_ChoiceB=And who do you think you are?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_31_Any_Default=Some Manacalon emperor?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_32_Any_Default=Your empire is dead!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_33_Malariel_NPC=My lord!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_34_Malariel_NPC=Please allow me me to slaughter these…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_35_Orenetis_NPC=NO!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_36_Orenetis_NPC=I appreciate your offer, Malariel.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_37_Orenetis_NPC=But I was insulted here, not you.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_38_Any_ChoiceC=Who's in charge here - her, or you?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_39_Orenetis_NPC=At least she knows the meaning of respect.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_40_Orenetis_NPC=Unlike you.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_41_Orenetis_NPC=Get out of my palace, you're not welcome in my home.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_42_Any_ChoiceD=Please accept our apologies, Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_43_Any_Default=We only wish to learn your ways.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_44_Orenetis_NPC=Your modesty is appreciated.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_45_Orenetis_NPC=Well, the rules are simple.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_46_Orenetis_NPC=This is my Dominion. I protect its inhabitants, and I provide for them.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_47_Orenetis_NPC=Despite their ugliness, they are my people.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_48_Orenetis_NPC=Of course I only allow beings of higher quality in my…personal space.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_49_Orenetis_NPC=Now, if I may…how did you end up here?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_50_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=We were looking for someone.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_51_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=We stumbled on a redeemer's nest.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_52_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=We're just fortune hunters.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_53_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=We prefer not to say.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_54_Any_ChoiceA=We're after a man called Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_55_Any_Default=We have reason to believe that he is in your valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_56_Orenetis_NPC=Strange…Malariel?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_57_Malariel_NPC=Our agents did not report any foreigner of that name.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_58_Orenetis_NPC=An elusive person, your Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_59_Any_ChoiceB=We were in the mountains nearby…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_60_Any_Default=…we stumbled across a nest of redeemers.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_61_Any_Default=Our only choice was to enter the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_62_Orenetis_NPC=Ah! My children of filth…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_63_Orenetis_NPC=They guard my Dominion from intruders…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_64_Orenetis_NPC=…and from…well…those who would escape my justice.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_65_Any_ChoiceC=We're just looking for money and glory.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_66_Orenetis_NPC=Well! There's no shame in following your bliss, I suppose.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_67_Orenetis_NPC=I myself enjoy beauty most of all… perhaps a little too much.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_68_Any_ChoiceD=That's a secret.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_69_Orenetis_NPC=Oh - secrets…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_70_Orenetis_NPC=I'm a very curious individual, you know.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_71_Orenetis_NPC=If you have secrets - well, I simply have to know them.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_72_Orenetis_NPC=Anyway, since you're here…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_73_Orenetis_NPC=Maybe you'd like to earn the favor of your new protector?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_74_Orenetis_NPC=And his trust?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_75_Orenetis_NPC=My soldiers are good fighters, but…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_76_Orenetis_NPC=…I hate dirtying their boots in the jungle.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_77_Orenetis_NPC=But I need some things from those clearings…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_78_Orenetis_NPC=…so why don't you go and fetch them for me?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_79_Orenetis_NPC=For a suitable reward - and more importantly, my gratitude.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_80_Any_Default=I suppose we can do that.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_81_Orenetis_NPC=Excellent! My chancellor will provide you with a list.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_82_Orenetis_NPC=I'll see you when you return with my things.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_1_Sima_NPC=Clear skies, travellers!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_2_Sima_NPC=My name is Sima Temple.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_3_Any_Default=Nice to meet you, Sima!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_4_Any_Default=We're looking for a man called Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_5_Any_Default=Have you heard of him?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_6_Sima_NPC=Marin Ving? No, sorry. Doesn't ring a bell.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_7_Sima_NPC=Where are you from?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_8_Any_Default=The Principality of Masgarth.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_9_Sima_NPC=I see. That's east of the Dominion.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_10_Any_Default=Do you know how to get there?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_11_Any_Default=Because we're kind of lost.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_12_Sima_NPC=Ha! As if you could get out!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_13_Any_Default=What do you mean?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_14_Sima_NPC=Our Lord Protector doesn't let anyone leave.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_15_Sima_NPC=Even if you cross the jungle and the swamps…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_16_Sima_NPC=…you'll end up facing armies of redeemers.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_17_Any_Default=Like that nest we escaped before arriving here.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_18_Sima_NPC=Bad luck, I guess.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_19_Any_Default=You don't like the Lord Protector?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_20_Sima_NPC=I'd never say that.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_21_Any_Default=Anything we should know about him?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_22_Sima_NPC=Can I trust you?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_23_Any_Default=Of course!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_24_Sima_NPC=There's a guard in front of the gate, over there.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_25_Sima_NPC=He confiscated something that belongs to me.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_26_Sima_NPC=A book.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_27_Sima_NPC=Bring it back and maybe I'll trust you.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_28_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Steal it?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_29_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Any idea how to recover it?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_30_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Fine!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_31_NOAUDIO_Choice=Why did he take it?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_32_Any_Selfpres=You want us to steal from a city guard?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_33_Sima_NPC=If you want me to trust you.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_34_Any_Pragmatic=How do you expect us to get it?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_35_Sima_NPC=You could ask really, really nicely.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_36_Sima_NPC=But I don't think that would work.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_37_Any_Pragmatic=Steal it, then?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_38_Sima_NPC=I'd never say that.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_39_Any_Violence=I see!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_40_Sima_NPC=See you, then!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_41_Any_Lawful=It must have been confiscated for a reason.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_01_42_Sima_NPC=Not a good one.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_1_Esfalad_NPCBanter=Here's the list. Thanks for volunteering.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_03_2_Esfalad_NPCBanter=Oh - and I activated the Minor Gate. It's a faster way out of the city.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_1_Orenetis_NPC=Excellent!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_2_Orenetis_NPC=This will be very useful.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_3_Orenetis_NPC=Your cooperation pleases me.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_5_Orenetis_NPC=I will have other…needs in the future, and I may call on you again.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_6_Any_Default=How can we serve you further?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_7_Orenetis_NPC=I'm looking for some peculiar monsters that are rumored to roam throughout my Dominion.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_8_Orenetis_NPC=Let's call them…variants.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_9_Orenetis_NPC=One of them is supposed to be a giant dryad.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_10_Orenetis_NPC=I've a list of other rumored creatures.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_11_Orenetis_NPC=I want study the possibility of their existence…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_12_Orenetis_NPC=…as well as their biology.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_13_Orenetis_NPC=Bring me parts of these monsters - heads, at least.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_14_Orenetis_NPC=You'll be rewarded, as before.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_15_Orenetis_NPC=My chancellor will receieve your discoveries.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_30_Esfalad_NPC_Banter_Waiting=I will pay you for each one of the Lord Protector's…collectibles that you bring to me.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_31_Esfalad_NPC_Banter_ReturnItem=A most wonderful find!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_32_Esfalad_NPC_Banter_ReturnItem=Excellent work, dear friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_04_33_Esfalad_NPC_Banter_ReturnItem=The Lord Protector will be delighted!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_05=Something's blocking the door!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_06=For the love of… How many keys do we need?
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_07=These tracks might belong to the scientists.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_08=Looks like the elevator is no longer powered.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_09=I guess we need to find another way out.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_NPC_01=The elevator requires an activation prism. You can find one upstairs.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_NPC_02=I'm so tired! I spent the whole night working in the Test Lab.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_NPC_03=Oh! Thank you!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_NPC_04=I really need to rest now.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_1_Orenetis_NPC=Ah - here you are!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_2_Orenetis_NPC=I want you to do something for me.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_3_Orenetis_NPC=My assistant - one of them…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_4_Orenetis_NPC=…not exactly the brightest - but anyway…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_5_Orenetis_NPC=I sent him on an errand.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_6_Orenetis_NPC=In the swamps, to the west.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_7_Orenetis_NPC=Some rather uncivilized people live there…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_8_Orenetis_NPC=…anyway, he hasn't returned.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_9_Orenetis_NPC=I want you to find him and bring him back.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_10_Orenetis_NPC=If he's dead - well, bring back his equipment if you can.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_20_Orenetis_NPC=Lysantir! You're alive after all!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_21_Lysantir_NPC=My Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_22_Orenetis_NPC=We have much to talk about.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_23_Orenetis_NPC=Thank you, my friends, for bringing him back.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_24_Any_Default=You think we'll seem him again?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_25_Any_Default=In a coffin, maybe.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_1_Orenetis_NPC=He'll pay for his insolence!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_2_Malariel_NPC=My Lord, house Anfarel is…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_3_Orenetis_NPC=…do not tell me what they are…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_4_Orenetis_NPC=…I am quite well aware of what they are!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_5_Orenetis_NPC=Of course, their Imperial ties are meaningless now.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_6_Orenetis_NPC=My friends, you have proven to be loyal servants.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_7_Orenetis_NPC=I have a…delicate request for you.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_8_Orenetis_NPC=This elf, Eladien Anfarel - he dared to critize me, in public!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_9_Orenetis_NPC=In his miserable little village down in the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_10_Orenetis_NPC=Undermining my authority in front of my people!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_11_Orenetis_NPC=I need you to teach him some respect.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_12_Orenetis_NPC=Don't kill him, though. I want him on his knees, bleeding and begging for mercy.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_13_Orenetis_NPC=Will you do that for me?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_14_Any_Default=Of course, Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_15_Orenetis_NPC=Very good. Be on your way, then.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_20_Any_Authority=We're looking for Eladien Anfarel.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_21_LordAnfarel_NPC=It's Lord Anfarel, if you don't mind.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_22_Any_Authority=Yes, we know - Imperial ties.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_23_Any_Authority=The Lord Protector sent us.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_24_Any_Authority=He heard you were quite rude about him.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_25_LordAnfarel_NPC=So, what - are you going to kill me?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_26_Any_Authority=Oh, no - we just want you to beg for mercy.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_27_Any_Lawful=We were supposed to spare him.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_28_Any_Violence=He would have killed us, given the chance.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_29_Any_Pragmatic=I don't think the Lord Protector will mind that much.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_30_Any_Friendly=I'm more worried about our reputation.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_30_LordAnfarel_NPC=Mercy!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_31_LordAnfarel_NPC=Please - don't kill me!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_32_Any_Authority=The Lord Protector grants you mercy.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_33_Any_Authority=Should you disrespect him again, though…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_34_Any_Authority=…he may be less forgiving.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_40_Any_Default=It is done, Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_41_Orenetis_NPC=Ah, yes - I heard already. The Anfarels are furious!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_42_Orenetis_NPC=I was told that Lord Anfarel is dead…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_43_Orenetis_NPC=…when I told you quite clearly to let him live in humiliation.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_44_Any_Default=He was…reluctant to kneel before your authority.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_45_Orenetis_NPC=Of course… of course.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_46_Orenetis_NPC=I hear of turmoil in the streets. I might need you again soon.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_47_Orenetis_NPC=Meanwhile, as a reward for your service, I've granted you access to my laboratory.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_48_Orenetis_NPC=Talk to Finaliel Sharpmind. She's in charge of the place.
Narration/&DLC1_NPCBanters1_Rose_NPC=Heya!
Narration/&DLC1_NPCBanters2_Rose_NPC=What's up, friends?
Narration/&DLC1_NPCBanters3_Rose_NPC=I hear you serve the Lord Protector now.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_1_Orenetis_NPC=Fools - all of them!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_2_Orenetis_NPC=Traitors and fools!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_3_Orenetis_NPC=I know you've heard!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_4_Orenetis_NPC=They're rising up against me, all across the valley!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_5_Orenetis_NPC=They took my outposts - in the jungle, in the marshes!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_6_Orenetis_NPC=Retake my guard towers and cleanse them of the stench of rebellion!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_7_Orenetis_NPC=Once that's done, we'll put an end to this uprising!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_1_Orenetis_NPC=Why wouldn't I?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_2_Orenetis_NPC=What did you do to stop these rebels?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_3_Orenetis_NPC=The Anfarels!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_4_Orenetis_NPC=Ha!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_5_Orenetis_NPC=How did it take you so long to find out?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_6_Orenetis_NPC=My friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_7_Orenetis_NPC=I have great news!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_8_Orenetis_NPC=We have identified those who threaten my rule!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_9_Orenetis_NPC=The Anfarels! You've already dealt with one of them.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_10_Orenetis_NPC=But they are an old and powerful family, from even before the Manacalon Empire.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_11_Orenetis_NPC=All this time, they've been secretly preparing their coup.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_12_Orenetis_NPC=They are led by one of their ancient warlords. I don't know which one…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_13_Orenetis_NPC=…but I know they have a base in the swamps far to the west.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_14_Orenetis_NPC=Follow this map, find the rebel leaders - and wipe them out!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_15_Orenetis_NPC=You will each have the title of General for this mission, and carry my full authority!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_08_16_Any_Authority=It shall be done, Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_1_Orenetis_NPC=Hendeolas Anfarel?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_2_Orenetis_NPC=I know that name.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_3_Orenetis_NPC=An ancient, ancient warlord and wizard.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_4_Orenetis_NPC=I knew that some of these old families used rituals to become mummies…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_5_Orenetis_NPC=Anyway, this great threat is now just a memory - Thanks to you, Generals.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_6_Orenetis_NPC=I am most impressed by your deeds.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_7_Orenetis_NPC=Yet I still have need of you, and I'm sure you will fulfill this last mission for your liege.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_8_Any_Authority=We will, Lord Protector, but then we wish to return home.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_9_Orenetis_NPC=Ah, yes, outsiders you were, outsiders you remain.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_10_Orenetis_NPC=Well, once you've done this, I will show you how, you have my word.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_12_Orenetis_NPC=I have built a facility, to the west, in the jungle.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_13_Orenetis_NPC=I have a Major Gate to travel there, but somehow it does not function anymore.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_14_Orenetis_NPC=I need you to travel down there and find out why.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_15_Orenetis_NPC=You should be able to return swiftly using the Gate.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_09_16_Orenetis_NPC=Here's the password. I suppose you know how to use it.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_1_Orenetis_NPC=You did it!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_2_Orenetis_NPC=Marvelous!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_3_Any_Default=The Major Gate is functional again, Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_4_Any_Default=There was a problem at the complex, though.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_5_Any_Default=Some monsters escaped. Many of your people down there were killed.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_6_Orenetis_NPC=I see.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_7_Orenetis_NPC=You have exceeded all my expectations.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_8_Orenetis_NPC=As promised, you shall be rewarded.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_9_Orenetis_NPC=This scepter will grant you passage through the redeemer's nest.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_10_Orenetis_NPC=As long as you carry it, they will not attack you. You can leave the valley and go on your way.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_10_11_Any_Default=Many Thanks, Lord Protector.
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Guard_Captain_01=If you are here to help, you will need this key to enter the Complex.
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Guard_Captain_02=You can enter through the main door.
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Guard_01=The elevator is currently locked. I think the key is upstairs.
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Guard_02=We received orders to lock the security gate.
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scientist_01=Thank you for your help!
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scientist_02=You can rest here if you want.
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scholar_01=Appreciate the help!
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scholar_02=These experiments are quite demanding.
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Guard_03=We are in lockdown! The prisoners have escaped!
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Guard_04=The tunnels are not safe any more!
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scientist_03=We had to barricade the doors. I hope we are safe!
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scientist_04=Believe me, you don't want to be in the tunnels right now !
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Complex_05b=What is happening? It looks like they're barricading themselves in…
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Complex_06b=That's crazy! What are they so afraid of?
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_07b=I have a bad feeling about this…
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_08b=Oh, come on !
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_09b=Looks like the elevator's mana power is cut!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_10b=I guess we have to find another way out!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_11b=They seem to be using some kind of mana generator.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_12b=Can we leave now ?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_10_Orenetis_NPC=Look who's here!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_11_Orenetis_NPC=I thought I made myself clear - all outposts must be back under my control.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_12_Orenetis_NPC=My informants tell me that's not the case.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_13_Orenetis_NPC=Do not come back until you've completed your mission!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_14_Orenetis_NPC=I'm very pleased.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_15_Orenetis_NPC=You have become my greatest assets in the struggle to keep control of my valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_16_Orenetis_NPC=Take a well-deserved rest. I will have more work for you later.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_07_17_Orenetis_NPC=You have re-established my authority over the valley?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_1_Telerien_NPC=Well met and rejoice, noble visitors!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_2_Telerien_NPC=My name is Telerien.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_4_Any_Default=Rejoice? In the middle of nowhere?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_5_Telerien_NPC=But of course! Rejoice to have met me!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_6_Any_Default=And who are you exactly?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_7_Telerien_NPC=You wouldn't hail from Masgarth, perchance?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_8_Any_Default=And what if we did?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_9_Telerien_NPC=Heard of the Scavengers?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_10_Any_Slang=Sure!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_11_Telerien_NPC=Well, here we call ourselves the Forge.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_13_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=What do you do?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_14_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Tell us about the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_16_Telerien_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_17_Any_ChoiceB=Would you care to remind us of your fields of activity, friend?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_18_Telerien_NPC=Of course. You clear a place of its, shall we say, inhabitants…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_19_Telerien_NPC=…you tell us where, we bring out what you left behind and resell it.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_20_Telerien_NPC=And you get your fair share of the gleanings.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_21_Any_Lawful=And your share is… quite generous?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_22_Telerien_NPC=It is, but consider the time and trouble you save!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_23_Any_Default=And what other services do you offer?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_24_Telerien_NPC=Information, magical components, sometimes items and…we can always use some help!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_25_Any_Lawful=Help? What kind of help?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_26_Telerien_NPC=The profitable kind! You help us, and we help you!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_27_Telerien_NPC=And, in time, out of an encounter in the swamps, blossoms true friendship!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_28_Telerien_NPC=Which reminds me - I have a small errand, if you're interested!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_29_Any_Default=We're listening. What's the job?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_30_Telerien_NPC=Deliver a pack of meat to the capital city.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_31_Telerien_NPC=My friend Henrik, the butcher, will give you a receipt to bring back to me.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_34_Telerien_NPC_if_No=Oh, well. There's always tomorrow!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_35_Telerien_NPC_if_Yes=Many Thanks!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_37_Any_ChoiceC=What do you know about this less than fair valley?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_38_Telerien_NPC=It is sealed off from the outside, since the only exits are controlled by the redeemers.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_39_Telerien_NPC=The ruler of the valley is called Orenetis. He is some kind of magician.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_40_Telerien_NPC=He lives in the city - in the upper city, to be precise!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_41_NOAUDIO_Choice1=Redeemers?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_42_NOAUDIO_Choice2=The City?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_43_NOAUDIO_Choice3=Orenetis?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_44_Any_Choice1=What can you tell us about the Redeemers?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_45_Telerien_NPC=Giant insects, very aggressive and territorial. They live in the mountains all around the Valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_46_Any_Choice1=That bad?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_47_Telerien_NPC=I never heard of any way around them!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_48_Any_Choice3=This city you mentioned?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_49_Telerien_NPC=Caer Hyfryd, an ancient Manacalon garrison city.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_50_Any_History=The name 'Caer' does hint at a Manacalon origin, before the Cataclysm.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_51_Any_Normal=A Manacalon fortress? It survived the Cataclysm?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_52_Telerien_NPC=I've been there, and the architecture is clearly Imperial. There really is no accounting for taste…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_53_Any_Normal=You mentioned an upper city.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_54_Telerien_NPC=Aye - Orenetis and his court live there. The lower city is home to the common folk…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_55_Telerien_NPC=Orenetis isn't quite as…racist as the Empire was, but his inner circle, they're only high elves…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_56_Any_Choice3=Orenetis is the ruler?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_57_Telerien_NPC=Yes - our beloved Lord Protector!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_58_Any_Default=Was he already the ruler at the time of Cataclysm?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_59_Telerien_NPC=Possible, thought I wasn't around at that time!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_60_Any_History=Unlikely, surprising, and yet - fascinating!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_62_Telerien_NPC=We meet again! I hope the valley treated you well!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_63_Any_Default=Clear skies, friend!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_64_Any_Slang=Can't complain!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_65_Telerien_NPC=I still have this small errand, if you're interested!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_66_Any_Default=The delivery to Henrik?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_67_Telerien_NPC=Yes indeed! We just got some fresh meat again!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_68_Any_Default_Yes=We'll take care of it!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_69_Any_Default_No=No, thanks!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_70_Telerien_NPC=Oh well, there is always tomorrow!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_36_NOAUDIO_Return=Change topic
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_1_Samko_NPC=Hey there.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_2_Samko_NPC=Name's Samko Flint.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_4_Samko_NPC=Telerien must have asked you to do something for us.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_5_Samko_NPC=I'd like to ask you something, too…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_6_Samko_NPC=…since I gather you're trekking through the area.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_7_Any_Default=What do you need ?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_8_Samko_NPC=Some friends of mine vanished while checking some ruins nearby.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_9_Samko_NPC=As surely as if a blizzard buried them on the tundra!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_10_Any_Default=And you want us to find them?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_11_Samko_NPC=If they are alive, please bring them back!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_12_Samko_NPC=If you find proof of their deaths, I'd like to return it to their families.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_13_Any_Default=What proof would that be?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_14_Samko_NPC=They'd carry an amulet of the Forge, like mine.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_15_Samko_NPC=If you find corpses with that…well…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_16_Samko_NPC=Don't underestimate the dangers of this valley!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_17_Samko_NPC=I am not sending you after a remorhaz, but watch out nonetheless!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_18_Samko_NPC=Thanks, friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_01_19_Samko_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_2_Rose_NPC=Hey friends, do you have a minute?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_4_Rose_NPC=The people of the city need a favor, I think you might be able to help.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_6_Rose_NPC=There's this elf, a nobleman and a drunkard.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_7_Rose_NPC=Every night he bullies poor citizens near the Merry Remorhaz.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_8_Rose_NPC=Someone needs to give him a…lesson in manners, if you take my meaning.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_9_Any_Violence=I think we do. A punch in the face, perhaps?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_10_Any_Friendliness=We could speak to him without violence.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_11_Any_Pragmatic=We'll see.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_12_Rose_NPC=I don't want to lie to you. If he's hurt, he might go whining to the Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_13_Any_Selfpres=So, it's probably better just to scare him?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_14_Rose_NPC=That's for sure!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_15_Any_Friendliness=Don't worry, Rose - we'll take care of him!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_16_Rose_NPC=You're the best!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_18_Any_Pragmatic=Hey, Rose! I think we took care of your problem.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_19_Any_Pragmatic=Hey, Rose! Sorry - things didn't go as planned.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_20_Rose_NPC=Well done! I don't think we'll see him around for a while.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_21_Rose_NPC=Well, I suppose it'll do the job.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_22_Rose_NPC=I hope the Lord Protector won't come after you, though!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_23_Any_Default=Don't worry about that!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_24_Rose_NPC=Well, if you have time, I heard that Henrik needed a hand with something.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_1_Henrik_NPC=Ah, here you are!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_2_Henrik_NPC=Rose told me what you did for us.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_3_Henrik_NPC=True friends of the people, you are.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_4_Any_Default=Don't mention it.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_5_Henrik_NPC=So if you feel like doin' some more justice around here…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_6_Henrik_NPC=…someone from the guard is a real poison.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_7_Henrik_NPC=Lieutenant Sharp-Eyes.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_8_Henrik_NPC=She's killed some innocent folk, I know that for sure.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_9_Henrik_NPC=She uses her position to extort, steal, and brutalize honest citizens.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_10_Any_Default=Let me guess, you'd like us to deal with this… Lieutenant Sharp-Eyes?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_11_Henrik_NPC=That'd be a great service to the people.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_12_Henrik_NPC=Frankly, I wouldn't mourn her death, but it's not our way.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_13_Henrik_NPC=I hear she's after a posting closer to her home village.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_14_Henrik_NPC=Also, I'm pretty sure she has a jeweled ring that she stole from the palace.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_15_Any_Default=Stealing from the Lord Protector?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_16_Any_Default=That's not smart - not smart at all!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_17_Henrik_NPC=I see you're catchin' my drift.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_18_Henrik_NPC=There are ways to get her away from here, anyhow. You'll find one, I'm sure.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_19_Any_Default=Sounds like we have a luxury of possibilities.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_20_Henrik_NPC=I heard the Lord Protector had Sharp-Eyes executed?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_21_Any_Default=Malariel Brogarad did, more like.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_22_Henrik_NPC=Well, she's no altar girl, that one.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_23_Henrik_NPC=I heard Sharp-Eyes is gone?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_24_Any_Default=To a better place, so it seems.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_25_Henrik_NPC=Too bad her brutality might fall on other honest folk.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_26_Any_Default=She knows what could happen if we were to denounce her.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_27_Henrik_NPC=Fine. Thanks for your help, friends!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition1_Rose_NPC=I meant to say - someone from our community would like to speak with you. Someone important.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition2_Rose_NPC=It's Reya, the cleric.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition3_Any_Normal=We know her. She's part of your little band, then?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition4_Any_Formal=We've been introduced, though we had no idea she was part of your organization.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition5_Rose_NPC=Well, we're just people helping each other, but Reya is very active and well respected.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition6_Any_Default=We'll talk to her, then.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_Transition7_Rose_NPC=And thanks again for your support, my friends.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_2_Player_Default=It seems she looks up to you.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_3_Reya_NPC=Well, she trusted you enough to confide…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_4_Reya_NPC=As a cleric, I have to do more than just pray.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_5_Reya_NPC=The people of the valley need help against the tyrant.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_6_Player_Default=Orenetis?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_7_Reya_NPC=He's not evil, really. Probably just…sick.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_8_Reya_NPC=He's not always been that way.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_9_Reya_NPC=Now he trusts awful people to do his bidding.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_10_Reya_NPC=Like Malariel Brogarad.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_11_Reya_NPC=She lets her high-elf guards treat us like we're Manacalon slaves.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_12_Player_Default=That's unacceptable.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_13_Reya_NPC=Indeed.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_14_Reya_NPC=One of our friends is being held - and probably tortured - in one of the Lord Protector's outposts.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_15_Player_Default=A military garrison?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_16_Reya_NPC=I know it's a lot to ask, but you've done so much already.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_17_Player_Default=We'll be personae non gratae if we attack that place.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_18_Reya_NPC=If you can get him out without a slaughter, I'd be glad.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_19_Reya_NPC=But if there's no other way…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_20_Player_Default=Understood.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_21_Reya_NPC=Thanks a lot, friends.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_22_PeopleGuy_NPC=Thank you!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_23_Player_Default=You can thank Reya when you see her.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_24_PeopleGuy_NPC=She sent you?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_25_Player_Default=She did.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_26_PeopleGuy_NPC=I can't go back to the city. I'll hide at my brother's.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_27_Player_Default=As you wish, friend.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_28_Player_Slang=Shit!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_29_Player_Normal=Damn!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_30_Player_Formal=That is… less than satisfactory.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_31_Player_Liar=We could tell Reya she was already dead…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_32_Player_Truthteller=We tried. We risked our lives, but it wasn't enough.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_33_Player_Pragmatic=Let's go back.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_1_Rose_NPC=My friends!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_2_Player_Default=Rose, what's going on?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_3_Rose_NPC=They took Reya!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_4_Player_Default=What? Who?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_5_Rose_NPC=Brogarad's praetorians, they accused her of plotting against the Lord Protector!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_6_Player_Cynical=Well, that's not entirely wrong…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_7_Player_Lawful=Shut up!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_8_Rose_NPC=Can you save her?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_9_Player_Default=Do you think they'll kill her?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_10_Rose_NPC=No one comes back from these arrests!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_11_Rose_NPC=They're interrogating her in public. That gives us our only chance.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_12_Rose_NPC=If you go now, you can…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_13_Player_Selfpres=Attack city guards ?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_14_Player_Selfpres=Orenetis will kill us!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_15_Rose_NPC=I understand…if you do this, we'll owe you everything.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_16_Rose_NPC=We'll hide you.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_17_Rose_Cynical=Looks like there's more to the little beggar than meets the eye.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_18_Rose_NPC=It's up to you.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_19_Rose_NPC=I know you'll do the right thing.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_1_Reya_NPC=My friends!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_2_Reya_NPC=You took an awful risk to save me!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_3_Player_Cynical=You don't say.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_4_Player_Friendly=Don't mention it, Reya! Come on - we need to hide!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_5_Reya_NPC=We have a safe place, right under their noses! Follow me!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_6_Rose_NPC=Reya! You're alive!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_7_Reya_NPC=Thanks to them!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_8_Reya_NPC=I told you they could be trusted!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_9_Reya_NPC=Well, they certainly proved it!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_10_Reya_NPC=Orenetis will know it's you. He's got eyes almost everywhere.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_11_Player_Selfpres=But not here?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_12_Reya_NPC=His weakness is that he trusts people based on how they look…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_13_Reya_NPC=…he doesn't mind if they're stupid or incompetent.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_14_Player_Cynical=I figured as much.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_15_Reya_NPC=Well, now, the status quo is over - he's onto us!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_16_Player_Selfpres=Who is 'us'?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_17_Rose_NPC=The people of the city. We're more than just a mob, you know.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_18_Rose_NPC=We are organized, we plan operations, we struggle against tyranny.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_19_Player_Selfpres=Are we in a rebel hideout right now?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_20_Reya_NPC=No.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_21_Reya_NPC=The rebels are political opponents, really.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_22_Reya_NPC=I doubt the people would be happier if they overthrew Orenetis.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_23_Reya_NPC=They'd put another high-elf noble on a throne, probably from house Anfarel.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_24_Player_Default=Oh…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_25_Rose_NPC=We don't want a civil war, just to live our lives.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_26_Player_Violence=And yet you say the status quo is over.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_27_Reya_NPC=Orenetis is going too far. I simply complained about a stock of food being confiscated.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_28_Reya_NPC=In response, Brogarad had me arrested.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_29_Reya_NPC=We need to take that food back.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_30_Reya_NPC=It's piled up in one of Orenetis's outposts.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_31_Player_Selfpres=We could do that, but how do we leave the city without running into the guards?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_32_Reya_NPC=There's one place the guards never go…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_33_Reya_NPC=Good job, kids!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_34_Player_Default=There's a mountain of food here!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_35_Reya_NPC=Indeed! Grown by the people, for the people.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_36_Reya_NPC=Thank you again! We owe you so much.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_37_Reya_NPC=I need to organize its distribution, but when that's done, I'll return to the safe house in the city.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_38_Reya_NPC=Meet me there if you want to help more.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_39_Reya_NPC=You've gone too far to stop.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_40_Reya_NPC=The people regard you as heroes, now.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_41_Player_Cynical=Do we drink for free at the safe house, then?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_42_Player_Violence=I hope we can play darts with a portrait of the Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_43_Player_Lawful=This is serious, friends.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_07_44_Player_Lawful=We'll see you soon, Reya.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_1_Reya_NPC=Here you are!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_2_Reya_NPC=Any problems entering the city?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_3_Player_Cynical=As you said, the guards aren't that bright.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_4_Player_Friendly=They don't even patrol the temple.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_5_Reya_NPC=Good.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_6_Reya_NPC=I have something to confess.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_7_Player_Selfpres=Uh, what?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_8_Reya_NPC=I'm not the leader of the people in the city.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_9_Player_Selfpres=Who, then?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_10_Reya_NPC=Our favorite little beggar.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_11_Player_Friendly=Rose?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_12_Rose_NPC=Leader is a big word for me.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_13_Rose_NPC=Let's say I don't have much else to do but help my friends.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_14_Player_Pragmatic=No offense, but, does it matter?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_15_Rose_NPC=Not really.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_16_Reya_NPC=But Rose has found some important information.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_17_Player_Pragmatic=We're all ears!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_18_Reya_NPC=Orenetis has a secret place, hidden deep in the jungle.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_19_Reya_NPC=He used to go there every week, using some kind of magic gate…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_20_Reya_NPC=…but not any more.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_21_Reya_NPC=We know that some of his…opponents have been taken there.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_22_Reya_NPC=As well as slaves from outside the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_23_Reya_NPC=We could have been among them.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_24_Player_Friendly=You?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_25_Reya_NPC=Escaped slaves, yes.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_26_Rose_NPC=I believe something happened in that secret complex.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_27_Rose_NPC=Maybe a slave uprising.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_28_Rose_NPC=Whatever's going on, it's still guarded from the outside.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_29_Rose_NPC=If you agree to go, I can give you a map.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_30_Rose_NPC=Free our people, that's all we ask.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_31_Player_NonElf=Freeing slaves? You don't even have to ask!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_32_Player_Violence=Give us the map - we're in!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_08_33_Rose_NPC=Many Thanks, friends!
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scientist_05=We can't leave the lab - there are too many mutants out there!
Narration/&NPC_Complex_Scientist_06=We had to destroy the gate so the mutants couldn't escape!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_1_Rose_NPC=You did it, you…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_2_Rose_NPC=Orenetis!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_3_Sitenero_NPC=Please, child - I'm not him!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_4_Player_Default=It's a long story.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_5_Player_Default=This is Rose. She sent us here to save prisoners - slaves…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_6_Sitenero_NPC=I see. You are a brave halfling.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_7_Rose_NPC=Thanks…I guess…but if you're not him… then who are you?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_8_Sitenero_NPC=To put it simply, I'm his good side - the part he lacks.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_9_Rose_NPC=He definitely does!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_10_Rose_NPC=And if we could somehow put the two sides back together - would he be… nicer?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_11_Sitenero_NPC=I believe so, though he has to be willing.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_12_Rose_NPC=We have to try. Things can't go on as they are.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_13_Sitenero_NPC=He'll take some convincing.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_14_Player_Cynical=It'll be hard to talk to him without all his goons around.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_15_Rose_NPC=I may know a way.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_16_Player_Pragmatic=Really?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_17_Rose_NPC=There's a secret passage into the palace.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_18_Rose_NPC=Only the servants know about it.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_19_Player_Violence=And you never tried using that passage to murder Orenetis?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_20_Rose_NPC=No one dared.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_21_Rose_NPC=It leads right into his winter garden.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_22_Rose_NPC=Would you face him? Help us convince him to…reunite?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_23_Sitenero_NPC=It seems to be the only way, though I confess it scares me little.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_24_Player_Pragmatic=Fine, then.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_25_Player_Pragmatic=If we do this, can you help us get out of the valley?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_26_Sitenero_NPC=Ah - you mean the redeemers?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_27_Sitenero_NPC=He controls their queen.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_28_Sitenero_NPC=If we succeed, then yes, I'll be able to help you.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_29_Player_Pragmatic=Great! We have a plan - finally.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_30_Rose_NPC=Meet me at the safe house. I'll show you how to infiltrate the palace.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_31_Rose_NPC=You did it! You freed the slaves!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_32_Player_Default=This place is sick…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_33_Player_Pragmatic=A reflection of Orenetis' mind.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_34_Player_Violence=We put an end to his experiments.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_35_Rose_NPC=Good. The valley doesn't need any more monsters.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_09_36_Rose_NPC=You'll always be welcome in our houses, friends.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_1_Telerien_NPC=Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_5_Telerien_NPC=Many Thanks for the package from Henrik!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_6_Any_Default=Doing our job!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_7_Telerien_NPC=About jobs - I need your help again.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_8_Any_Default=Another delivery?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_9_Telerien_NPC=Not exactly. This job needs a more direct approach…- and involves some danger.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_10_Any_Slang=What kind of danger?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_11_Telerien_NPC=Nothing to worry strong souls like you, my friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_12_Telerien_NPC=But one of our customers needs spider poison glands!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_15_Any_Default=Glands?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_16_Telerien_NPC=Yes. I can give you the location of a spider nest nearby!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_17_Any_Default=If the nest is nearby, why don't you take care of it yourself?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_18_Telerien_NPC=My friend, I'm a businessman. I can't do everything!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_19_Any_Sarcastic=At least you are honest enough to admit it!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_02_20_Telerien_NPC=And besides, such errands are a great way to… strengthen our friendship.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_1_Player_Any=Well…still no sign of civilization…
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_2_Player_Cynical=…I remember Galar saying…
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_3_Player_Cynical=…oh, you're too green for the Badlands.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_4_Player_Authority=Stop whining. We're alive.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_5_Player_Selfpres=Think we can still find this Marin Ving?
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS01_6_Player_Selfpres=I say if we can get out of here, we just forget him and go home.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_1_Telerien_NPC=Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_3_Telerien_NPC=Lovely spider glands you brought me!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_4_Player_Default=Happy to help!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_5_Telerien_NPC=It's clear you're both capable and reliable, so I have another request…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_7_Telerien_NPC=…or rather, a forceful message to be delivered to some annoying neighbors.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_8_Player_Slang=Annoying neighbors ?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_9_Telerien_NPC=Yes! Not far from here, there's a small settlement of giants.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_10_Telerien_NPC=They make our operations in this area more… complicated than we'd like.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_11a_Player_Default=We already took care of your giants!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_11b_Player_Default=And you want us to…?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_12a_Telerien_NPC=I know, and Thanks!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_12b_Telerien_NPC=…to take care of the problem.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_13b_Player_Default=Meaning, kill a bunch of giants?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_13b_Telerien_NPC=Whatever it takes. Just as long as we can continue our operations unhindered.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_14b_Player_Default=And exactly what would it take?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_15b_Telerien_NPC=I don't know - kill them, perhaps, or bribe them, or drive them away. Whatever works.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_19b_Telerien_NPC_if_Yes=Thanks!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_25_Player_Goodbye=Stay in the light, friend!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_25_Telerien_NPC=What news of the giants?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_1_Telerien_NPC=I heard you dealt with those giants!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_2_Player_Default=We sure did!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_3_Telerien_NPC=We have no idea how this is…helping us.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_4_Telerien_NPC=I can't Thank you enough!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_5_Player_Default=Any time!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_6_Telerien_NPC=You have been great friends to me and my organization!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_7_Player_Default=Glad to hear it!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_8_Telerien_NPC=And we feel that should be recognized!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_9_Player_Default=With another, harder job, I suppose?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_10_Telerien_NPC=Oh, no - just another courier job. Not dangerous, but very confidential!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_11_Telerien_NPC=We had to be sure of you, because this job will take you to our main base in the swamps!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_12_Telerien_NPC=I'll give you some directions!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=Welcome…visitors.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_2_Hasdrubal_NPC=How did you find us?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_3_Player_Default=Telerien sent us. We met near the waterfall.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_4_Player_Default=He gave us this for you.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_5_Hasdrubal_NPC=Ah, I see.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_6_Hasdrubal_NPC=He speaks highly of you!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_7_Player_Default=Glad to hear that!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_8_Hasdrubal_NPC=Did he give you something for me? A package?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_9_Player_Default=Here you go!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_10_Hasdrubal_NPC=Many Thanks!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_11_Player_Default=Happy to be of service!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_12_Player_Greed=No.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_13_Player_Lawful=Eeeeh…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_14_Player_Greed=He didn't.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_15_Hasdrubal_NPC=I see…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_16_Hasdrubal_NPC=Well, you know our business - feel free to use our services.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_2_Hasdrubal_NPC=Perhaps you can help me with something.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_3_Player_Default=You're supposed to carry stuff around, not us.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_4_Hasdrubal_NPC=Yes, yes - I get the sarcasm…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_5_Hasdrubal_NPC=No, you won't have to carry anything heavier than a pointed message!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_6_Hasdrubal_NPC=A herd of dryads lives nearby, and they keep harassing us.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_7_Player_Default=Why?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_8_Hasdrubal_NPC=They only like animal visitors, it seems. I suppose we're trespassing.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_9_Player_Default=Don't tell us you can't take on a bunch of dryads!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_10_Hasdrubal_NPC=We could, but there are whispers of…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_11_Hasdrubal_NPC=…a dryad queen, whom we dare not anger!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_12_Hasdrubal_NPC=You're new here, and if you act swiftly…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_13_Hasdrubal_NPC=…the blame won't fall on us.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_14_Hasdrubal_NPC=Then we can continue our activities peacefully.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_15_Player_Cynical=What activities? Scapegoating?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_16_Hasdrubal_NPC=I get it - you're the funny one? Who's the grown-up one?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_17_Player_Authority=Apologies…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_18_Hasdrubal_NPC=That would be very much appreciated.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_19_Hasdrubal_NPC=Rumor says that if you sleep under the millenium tree, the dryad queen will appear.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_Start_20_Hasdrubal_NPC=It's not far, to the east.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=Greetings, my friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_2_Hasdrubal_NPC=Let's cut to the chase.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_3_Player_Default=Go ahead!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_4_Hasdrubal_NPC=I need seasoned adventurers to escort some of my people to a meeting.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_5_Player_Default=Why do they need an escort?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_6_Hasdrubal_NPC=To be honest with you, I'm not entirely sure how this meeting might go down.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_7_Hasdrubal_NPC=The people we're meeting with are… opponents of Orenetis.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_8_Player_Insight=Opponents?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_9_Hasdrubal_NPC=Well, rebels would probably be a more accurate term.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_10_Player_Default=Rebels, huh?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_11_Hasdrubal_NPC=Yes. Orenetis isn't as universally loved as he would like you to think!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_12_Player_Insight=Why do you fear the rebels?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_13_Hasdrubal_NPC=Like them, we prefer to live far from the Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_14_Hasdrubal_NPC=But we don't share their…appetite for trouble.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_15_Hasdrubal_NPC=There have already been some…misunderstandings.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_16_Hasdrubal_NPC=I want us to remain neutral but the rebels…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_17_Hasdrubal_NPC=…they want us to take sides.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_18_Player_Default=All right. How do we get there?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_19_Hasdrubal_NPC=Talk to Hanno. He has a map.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_20_Hasdrubal_NPC=And Thanks!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End1_Hasdrubal_NPC=Is it done? The dryads?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End2_Player_Default=It is. We have their queen's head.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End3_Hasdrubal_NPC=Impressive!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End4_Hasdrubal_NPC=You know, I would buy this trophy for a good price…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End5_Hasdrubal_NPC=…unless you have any other use for it?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End6_Hasdrubal_NPC=Deal!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End7_Hasdrubal_NPC=As you wish.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_01_47_Rose_NPC=Of course!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_29_Player_Any=We took care of your problem, Henrik.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_20_Rose_NPC=I can't believe she's dead.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_06_21_Rose_NPC=We lost our way…lost our light.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_17_Player_Any=By chance, really. We're just exploring the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_18_Hasdrubal_NPC=Right. We're peaceful people, so I hope you'll respect our privacy.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_19_Player_Any=This place looks like a Scavenger's outpost.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_20_Hasdrubal_NPC=We're basically Scavengers who got lost in the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_21_Hasdrubal_NPC=We call ourselves the Forge.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_22_Player_Any=Oh, great - so you provide the same services as in the Principality?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_23_Hasdrubal_NPC=Absolutely! We'll do business with you the very same way.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_1_Player_Default=They don't look like typical bandits to me.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_2_Player_Default=Hasdrubal told us this meeting could be a trap.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_3_Player_Default=So what do we do?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_4_Player_Default=We can go on to the meeting point openly…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_5_Player_Default=…or be prepared for treachery.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_6_Player_Default=We have to get to the bottom of this.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Attacked_7_Player_Default=Let's go!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_1_Blue_NPC=Clear skies!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_2_Blue_NPC=You're late!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_3_Any_Default=Yes. We had a spot of bother on the way.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_4_Any_Default=Bandits who seemed well-informed…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_5_Blue_NPC=Clearly you handled it!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_6_Blue_NPC=Do I know you?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_7_Any_Cynical=That night at the pub - was it you?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_8_Any_Authority=Shut up!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_9_Envoy_NPC=Look, Hasdrubal agrees to meet, but not just anywhere.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_10_Envoy_NPC=Show some trust and invite us to your headquarters.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_11_Blue_NPC=That's a lot to ask.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_12_Envoy_NPC=Considering that we've been attacked on our way here, the risk goes both ways.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_13_Blue_NPC=Fine, I'll pass it up the chain.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_14_Player_ChoiceA=You'll do nothing but die, traitor!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_15_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Attack the rebels
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_16_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Say goodbye
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_17_Player_Default=Look, Hasdrubal's envoy was killed. No point to this meeting any more.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=What happened?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_2_Player_Any=Bandits on the road.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_3_Envoy_NPC=The meeting took place, the rebels deny being involved.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_4_Envoy_NPC=Now we wait for their answer.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_5_Hasdrubal_NPC=Thanks for your escort, my friends.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_6_Hasdrubal_NPC=I'll need you again if we're invited.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_7_Hasdrubal_NPC=If you agree to come with me.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_8_Player_Any=Your envoy did not survive.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_9_Player_Any=It ended in blood.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_10_Hasdrubal_NPC=This is bad.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_06_Meeting_End_11_Hasdrubal_NPC=Well, you did what you could. Thank you.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=Thank you for coming, my friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_2_Any_Default=What news, Hasdrubal?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_3_Hasdrubal_NPC=I heard from the rebel leader, Ellaria Anfarel.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_4_Any_Default=Yes?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_5_Hasdrubal_NPC=They propose a meeting to ease the tensions between us!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_6_Any_Default=Need us to tag along?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_7_Hasdrubal_NPC=I'd feel better, yes.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_8_Any_Default=Happy to be of service!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_9_Hasdrubal_NPC=Good.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_10_Hasdrubal_NPC=They finally told me where they are based.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_11_Hasdrubal_NPC=It's an old buried Manacalon city called Dinas Gessa.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_12_Hasdrubal_NPC=Obviously, that is confidential.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=Greetings, My Lady!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_2_Ellaria_NPC=Greetings to you, Master Hasdrubal.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_3_Hasdrubal_NPC=Our last meetings were rudely interrupted.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_4_Ellaria_NPC=Indeed. Which is why I invited you here…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_5_Ellaria_NPC=…and to assure you that these mishaps were not our doing.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Tell them about Samko Flint
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Persuade them to make peace
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_8_NOAUDIO_Branch=Take sides
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Side with Forge
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_10_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Side with Rebellion
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_11_NOAUDIO_ChoiceE_Mask=Initiate combat against both factions
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_12_Player_Default=If you'll allow us…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_13_Player_Default=…you are right about those disruptions being suspicious.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_14_Player_Default=We managed to find their source.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_15_Player_Default=There is a double-tongued worm in the Forge!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_16_Ellaria_NPC=Who?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_17_Player_Default=An agent of the Mask - one Samko Flint
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_18_Hasdrubal_NPC=I wanted to tell you in person.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_19_Player_Default=We found a letter clearly instructing him to foment mistrust between us.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_20_Ellaria_NPC=This…Mask, who are they working for?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_21_Hasdrubal_NPC=Well. Things are clear now, and the Rebellion and the Forge can be friends.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_22_Ellaria_NPC=Absolutely. United against the tyrant Orenetis!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_23_Hasdrubal_NPC=We'll meet again, My Lady.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_24_Ellaria_NPC=Safe travels, my friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_21_Player_Default=This meeting is proof of goodwill on both sides!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_22b_Ellaria_NPC=Agreed. I'm sure you realize, revealing the location of our headquarters is a great proof of trust.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_23_Player_Default=And if both sides are keen to find common ground…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_24_Player_Default=…it then follows that… certain others may be worried…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_25_Player_Default=…about a closer relationship between the Rebellion and the Forge.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_26_Ellaria_NPC=Orenetis, obviously!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_27_Player_Default=Indeed, but you know his agents, don't you?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_28_Hasdrubal_NPC=True - he doesn't add new faces very often!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_29_Player_LafwfulnessOrElse=But there is a new player in the game.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_30_Player_LafwfulnessOrElse=Self-proclaimed champions of freedom, fighting Orenetis and his tyrrany…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_31_Player_LafwfulnessOrElse=… and also, perhaps, fighting you.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_32_Player_LafwfulnessOrElse=Who else but the Mask would have a motive to sow disruption amongst others?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_33_Ellaria_NPC_PersuasionDC15_Success=The Mask! Indeed!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_34_Hasdrubal_NPC_PersuasionDC15_Success=It seems we were played!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_35_Ellaria_NPC_PersuasionDC15_Failure=There's no proof they even exist.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_36_Hasdrubal_NPC_PersuasionDC15_Failure=This could all be a smokescreen to protect the true culprits.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_37_Any_Default=Just admit that you planned the attack on our last delegation!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_38_Ellaria_NPC=How dare you? We did not attack the Forge!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_39_Any_Default=You just don't want to share the secrets of your swamps.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_40_Any_Default=You fear the Forge might side with Orenetis.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_41_Ellaria_NPC=This is preposterous!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_42_Ellaria_NPC=Hasdrubal, why do you say nothing?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_43_Hasdrubal_NPC=I must admit, I've had the same thoughts.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_44_Hasdrubal_NPC=I do not believe that, My Lady. I trust you.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_45_Ellaria_NPC_IntimidationDC25_Success=Then I was wrong to entrust you with the location of this place.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_46_Ellaria_NPC_IntimidationDC25_Success=Clearly I cannot let you go, now.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_47_Ellaria_NPC_IntimidationDC25_Success=Choose your recruits more carefully, then.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_48_Ellaria_NPC_IntimidationDC25_Failure=Go, and don't come back. We will take care of ourselves, without your help.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_49_Any_Default=It's clear that Hasdrubal and the Forge manipulated you, my Lady.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_50_Hasdrubal_NPC=What?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_51_Any_Default=They crave the secrets of your buried city.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_52_Any_Default=They'd love to loot the treasures of Dinas Gessa.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_53_Any_Default=And now you told them just where to go.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_54_Hasdrubal_NPC=What's wrong with you? Why are you doing this to me?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_55_Ellaria_NPC_IntimidationDC25_Failure=I don't know who you think you are, but I've known Hasdrubal for a long time.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_56_Ellaria_NPC_IntimidationDC25_Failure=You, on the other hand… what's your agenda?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_57_Hasdrubal_NPC_IntimidationDC25_Failure=An excellent question! Looks like I've been fooled!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_58_Ellaria_NPC_IntimidationDC25_Success=I am very disappointed, Hasdrubal.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_59_Hasdrubal_NPC_IntimidationDC25_Success=They're lying!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_60_Any_Default=Ladies and gentlemen.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_61_Any_Default=You were right to be wary of traitors!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_62_Any_Default_If_Faction_Mask=The Mask sends his greetings!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_63_Hasdrubal_AfterBattle=This is bad.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_64_Hasdrubal_AfterBattle=Now we're at war.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_65_Ellaria_AfterBattle=A sad ending.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_07_Meeting_66_Ellaria_AfterBattle=We have more enemies than ever.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_1_Player_Default=We've got a package of meat from Telerien - that's for you, right?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_2_Henrik_NPC=Oh, you do?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_3_Henrik_NPC=Fantastic!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_4_Henrik_NPC=Dried ape ham - a delicacy for my halfling clients.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_5_Player_Default=Really? Ape ham?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_6_Henrik_NPC=Well, more or less. Very hard to find.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_7_Player_Default=Looks like there's plenty of apes down in the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_8_Henrik_NPC=Well, it's more that Telerien and his buddies don't want to come here.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_9_Player_Default=Why is that?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_01_Delivery_10_Henrik_NPC=Beats me. Ask him.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_1_Krim_NPC=Hey! I heard you killed a bear in there?
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_2_Krim_NPC=You wouldn't happen to have its pelt with you?
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_3_Player_Default=Why?
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_4_Krim_NPC=I got this crafting project. Boots.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_5_Krim_NPC=I need a brown bear's pelt.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=How much do you pay?
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=What are you crafting?
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_8_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=No
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Here you go
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_10_Player_Default=How much would you pay for it?
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_11_Krim_NPC=The usual, I guess - twenty gold pieces.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_12_Krim_NPC=Or I can show you how to craft something.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_13_Player_Default=What are you crafting?
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_14_Krim_NPC=Boots of the Winterland.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_15_Player_Default=Sorry, we don't have that.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_16_Krim_NPC=Sure, take it.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_17_Player_Default=Forget it.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_18_Player_Default=We'll take the gold.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_19_Player_Default=We'll take the recipe.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_20_Krim_NPC=Works for me.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_21_Krim_NPC=Deal.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_22_Krim_NPC=All right.
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_23_NOAUDIO_ChoiceE=The pelt for the recipe
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_24_NOAUDIO_ChoiceF=The pelt for 20gp
Narration/&DLC1_Valley_CS09_25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceG=Forget it
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_1_Player_Any=It's done!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_2_Sima_NPC=Impressive!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_3_Player_Any=So - what can you tell us now?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_4_Sima_NPC=Orenetis has enemies.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_5_Sima_NPC=An organized rebellion, hoping to dethrone him.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_6_Player_Any=Are you one of the rebels?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_7_Sima_NPC=I'd never say that.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_8_Player_Cynical=That's your catch-phrase, isn't it?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_9_Player_Any=She doesn't trust us yet, that's all.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_10_Sima_NPC=Old habits. Trust is a rare currency these days.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_11_Player_Cynical=Feels just like home…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_12_Player_Any=What if we'd like to know more about the rebellion?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_13_Sima_NPC=Bring me back another item that was taken from me.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_14_Player_Any=Really?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_15_Sima_NPC=It's a box, in the Gartis outpost.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_16_Sima_NPC=One of the Dominion's checkpoints in the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_17_Sima_NPC=If you bring it back to me, I'll tell you more.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_18_Sima_NPC=Maybe even something about your guy, Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_19_Player_Any=Ah.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_20_Player_Any=Now we have to kill Dominion soldiers?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_02_21_Sima_NPC=Again, proceed as you see fit. Maybe stealth will suffice.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_1_Sima_NPC=Great! You did well!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_2_Sima_NPC=Too bad you were spotted.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_3_Sima_NPC=Fortunately, they're not sure it was you, otherwise you would have been arrested already.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_4_Player_Default=Now, about our reward?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_5_Sima_NPC=Right.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_6_Sima_NPC=About your guy, I've heard rumors…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_7_Player_Default=…which is not the same as solid intelligence, of course…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_8_Sima_NPC=… but sometimes it's all we have.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_9_Sima_NPC=There's a group of people organizing secret meetings.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_10_Sima_NPC=They're good - I still haven't identified their leader.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_11_Sima_NPC=But it's a new thing, foreign.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_12_Sima_NPC=Maybe that's your man.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_13_Player_Default=Pretty thin on detail, but thanks anyway.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_14_Player_Default=Now, about the Rebellion. Can you tell us more?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_15_Sima_NPC=Not yet. Something came up.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_16_Player_Default=What now?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_17_Sima_NPC=Orenetis has placed a spy among some friends of mine.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_18_Sima_NPC=Take him out and you'll have my trust.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_19_Player_Default=Your trust doesn't come cheap.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_20_Sima_NPC=Your choice.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_21_Sima_NPC=The man is known as 'Charmer'.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_22_Player_Default=Is that…the Forge headquarters?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_23_Sima_NPC=I see you already know my friends.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_24_Sima_NPC=So you'll be happy to get them rid of this worm.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_AtForgeHQ_1_Player_Default=Murdering one of them, though? That doesn't seem… wise.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_AtForgeHQ_2_Player_Default=Right. I mean we have no proof he's a spy.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_AtForgeHQ_3_Player_Default=We could search his stuff.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_AtForgeHQ_4_Player_Default=Look at that.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=Charmer!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_2_Hasdrubal_NPC=Why did you do that?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_3_Player_Default=He was a spy for Orenetis!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_4_Hasdrubal_NPC=What?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_5_Hasbrubal_NPC=Can you prove it?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_6_Player_Default=The rebels told us.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_7_Hasdrubal_NPC=Oh, really? Who, exactly?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_8_Player_Default=Sima Temple.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_9_Player_Default=We can't tell.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_10_Hasdrubal_NPC=We'll investigate, but this is not acceptable.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_KilledCharmer_11_Hasdrubal_NPC=You should have come to me.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_10_Hasdrubal_NPC=The matter is in our hands now, but thank you for finding this.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_3_Player_Default=Your man Charmer - he's spying for Orenetis.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_11_Hasdrubal_NPC=Holy Maraike! What's going on?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_5_Player_Default=Take a look at this.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_2_Hasdrubal_NPC=What? Ridiculous! I've known him for years!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_4_Hasdrubal_NPC=You stole his backpack? That's really not…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_8_Player_Default=Look inside.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_6_Hasdrubal_NPC=A knighthood ring.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_7_Hasdrubal_NPC=No need. I know these rings. Bearing the sign of the Lord Protector himself.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_Incriminate_9_Hasdrubal_NPC=This is not solid proof, mind you, but we'll interrogate Charmer.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_1_Player_Default=Charmer has been arrested. He won't be a nuisance to the Forge anymore.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_2_Sima_NPC=So you didn't kill him?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_3_Player_Default=Did you want help, or did you want assassins?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_4_Sima_NPC=Fair enough.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_5_Player_Default=Charmer is no more.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_6_Sima_NPC=Good riddance!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_7_Player_Default=I think we deserve the whole truth now, don't we?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_8_Sima_NPC=Some of your actions still worry me.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_9_Sima_NPC=The rebellion requires total commitment.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_10_Sima_NPC=If you take some really decisive action against the tyrant, I'll introduce you to my superior.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_11_Player_Default=What do you want now?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_12_Sima_NPC=Take the Pertal outpost, and raise the flag of the rebellion on its walls.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_13_Player_Default=Is that all? Why not storm the palace while we're at it!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_14_Sima_NPC=We'll do that together, someday. If you really are what you claim to be.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_15_Sima_NPC=I suppose so. Go to the temple and talk to a woman in red.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_03_End_16_Sima_NPC=But if you'd like to take part in a decisive operation for the rebellion…
Narration/&DLC1_Hasdrubal_Banter_1_Charmer_Killed=You were right about Charmer.
Narration/&DLC1_Hasdrubal_Banter_2_Bad_Reputation=You're lucky I'm a businessman.
Narration/&DLC1_Hasdrubal_Banter_3_Good_Reputation=Clear skies, friends!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_End_1_Henrik_NPC=Tell me you have it…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_End_2_Henrik_NPC=Fantastic! Thanks a lot! Here's the money, as promised.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_02_End_3_Henrik_NPC=Take a slice of ham, on the house!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_1_Red_NPC=Hiya!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_2_Player_Any=Sima sent us, she said you'd lead us to…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_3_Red_NPC=…shhhh!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_4_Red_NPC=I'll show you on a map.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_5_Red_NPC=When you get there, look for a Tirmarian church.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_6_Red_NPC=Inside is a staircase. Don't mind the spider webs.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_7_Red_NPC=It's a direct entrance to our hideout.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_8_Red_NPC=The boss will know you're coming.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_9_Red_NPC=Strike True!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_10_Player_Any=That was…terse.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_1_Ellaria_NPC=Clear skies, friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_2_Ellaria_NPC=My name is Ellaria Anfarel, and this is the rebellion's headquarters.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_3_Player_Default=So you are the leader of the rebellion?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_4_Ellaria_NPC=No, just a trusted general.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_5_Ellaria_NPC=I gather you're foreigners?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_6_Ellaria_NPC=You've seen what kind of protector Orenetis really is.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_7_Player_Default=A bloody tyrant.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_8_Player_Default=A good, old-fashioned Manacalon racist.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_9_Ellaria_NPC=He's far worse than that. You don't know half of it.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_10_Ellaria_NPC=Anyway, if you're looking to fight for freedom, you've come to the right place.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_11_Player_Default=What's your plan?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_12_Ellaria_NPC=First of all, we need to secure our base.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_13_Ellaria_NPC=Our numbers are growing and we need to protect our allies.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_14_Ellaria_NPC=This place is well hidden, but not safe enough.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_15_Ellaria_NPC=Down this corridor are huge roots that keep breaking our walls.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_16_Ellaria_NPC=Agressive feys keep coming through.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_17_Ellaria_NPC=Whatever is spawning them, it has to go.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_18_Player_Default=And our job is to get it gone.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_19_Ellaria_NPC=That be a valuable service to our cause.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_20_Ellaria_NPC=I know it's dangerous. Feel free to rest in our…modest village.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_21_Ellaria_NPC=It is this way.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_22_Player_Default=What's behind you?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_MeetEllaria_23_Ellaria_NPC=Maybe one day I'll tell you.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_KilledMonster_1_Player_Default=I think we found the source of the attacks.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_KilledMonster_2_Player_Default=Let's take a souvenir back to Ellaria.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_1_Ellaria_NPC=That was fast!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_2_Ellaria_NPC=Did you find it?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_3_Player_Default=We think so.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_4_Player_Default=A shambling mound.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_5_Ellaria_NPC=That makes sense. They're very territorial.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_6_Ellaria_NPC=The ruins have been invaded by vegetation ever since the Cataclysm.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_7_Ellaria_NPC=Feys seem to think this place belong to them.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_8_Player_Default=Well, you can probably seal off access now. The roots will wither and die.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_9_Ellaria_NPC=Excellent work!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_10_Ellaria_NPC=I need to speak with my superior. I'll be back with another task for you.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_11_Player_Default=Remind me, what are we getting out of this?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_12_Player_Default=A way out of this crazy valley?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_End_13_Player_Default=Maybe some information about Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Palace_1_Player_Default=How did it go with your superior?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_2_Ellaria_NPC=Well enough. He has a further test for you.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_3_Player_Default=And…when do we get to meet the man?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_4_Ellaria_NPC=Who said it is a man?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_5_Player_Default=You said 'he'.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_04_FirstMeet_6_Ellaria_NPC=I suppose I did.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start7_Ellaria_NPC=He…does not trust easily.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start8_Ellaria_NPC=We need your help for something else.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start9_Ellaria_NPC=Down the corridor is another breach - a ruined staircase.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start10_Player_Default=We've seen it.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start11_Ellaria_NPC=It is possible to climb up through the debris.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start12_Ellaria_NPC=At the top is an old-fashioned Manacalon door.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start13_Ellaria_NPC=There's a wizard's palace, or what's left of it.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start14_Ellaria_NPC=Beyond it, there might be the remains of the wizard's laboratory, full of valuable items.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start15_Player_Default=But?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start16_Ellaria_NPC=It is guarded. Heavily.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start17_Player_Default=Too much for you, then?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start18_Ellaria_NPC=Our comrades are ready to die fighting Dominion soldiers in the cause of freedom…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start19_Ellaria_NPC=…not enchanted horrors for some reward that's beyond their comprehension.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start20_Player_Default=What kind of enchanted horrors, exactly?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start21_Ellaria_NPC=Elementals, golems…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Start22_Ellaria_NPC=…they're still active after a millenium, that is all we know for sure.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Lab_1_Player_Default=This place is incredible!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_Lab_2_Player_Default=Incredibly dangerous, more like.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_1_Player_Default=That's it - the lab is clear!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_2_Player_Default=There's one door we couldn't open, though.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_3_Player_Default=Yes, but the laboratory is accessible.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_4_Ellaria_NPC=Sima was right about you! You get things done.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_5_Player_Default=She said we'd get some answers, but we're still running errands for you.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_6_Ellaria_NPC=Fine. What do you want to know?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=How do we get out of the valley?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_8_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=What's with Orenetis?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=What if you overthrow Orenetis?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_10_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Have you heard of Marin Ving?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_11_Player_Default=We want to return home, but we can't get past the redeemers.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_12_Ellaria_NPC=Home? Well, I'm afraid only Orenetis controls the redeemers.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_13_Ellaria_NPC=You could try strength, but their juggernauts are…so powerful.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_14_Player_Default=Something's wrong with Orenetis. He's not a simple tyrant.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_15_Ellaria_NPC=I'm glad you noticed.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_16_Ellaria_NPC=Our leader says that he was not always like this.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_17_Ellaria_NPC=He's hiding something deep in the swamps. We're still looking for it.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_18_Player_Default=Your superior - he wants to replace Orenetis and rule the valley?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_19_Ellaria_NPC=It is his destiny to rule.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_20_Player_Default=Different name, same tyranny?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_21_Ellaria_NPC=I am well placed to guarantee the opposite.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_22_Player_Default=We're here looking for a man called Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_23_Ellaria_NPC=Ah, the cultist guru.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_24_Player_Default=What?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_25_Ellaria_NPC=There is word of a new cult in the valley…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_26_Ellaria_NPC=A human has gathered some followers.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_27_Ellaria_NPC=They worship a goddess, though their creed remains obscure.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_28_Ellaria_NPC=It has attracted all kinds of thieves, gamblers, beggars - even street clowns.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_29_Player_Default=Sounds a lot like Misaye.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_30_Ellaria_NPC=One of your outsider deities?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_31_Player_Default=Perhaps.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_32_Player_Default=So, where can we find the cultists?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_33_Ellaria_NPC=I have no idea. Not here, I hope.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_34_Player_Default=Well, it looks like helping you get to Orenetis could help us escape the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_35_Player_Default=How can we help the rebellion further?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_36_Ellaria_NPC=We plan to take control of all the outposts at once…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_37_Ellaria_NPC=…it would send a powerful message to the people.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_38_Ellaria_NPC=I'll mark them on your map, if you like.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_39_Ellaria_NPC=Then I'll gladly give you rebellion banners to raise.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_Start_1_Player_Default=What's going on?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_Start_2_Ellaria_NPC=Dominion troops! They're attacking the main entrance!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_Start_3_Player_Default=We can still leave.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_Start_4_Ellaria_NPC=It's time to pick a side! If we flee now, Ellaria won't ever forgive us.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_Start_5_Player_Default=Unless she dies.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_1_Ellaria_NPC=By the old ones! You saved us all!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_2_Player_Default=Well, we couldn't just run away.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_3_Ellaria_NPC=We can't stay here! Orenetis will send his redeemers…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_4_Ellaria_NPC=…but we have found his weakness!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_5_Ellaria_NPC=Meet Renno at headquarters. He'll take you to our lord.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_6_Ellaria_NPC=I must take care of the dead.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_Forge_1_Renno_NPC=I heard we repelled the enemy!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_Forge_2_Player_Default=For now - but they'll come back.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_Forge_3_Renno_NPC=I know. Ellaria sent me a message, you are to meet our lord, King Hendeolas Anfarel.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_Forge_4_Player_Default=Anfarel?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_Forge_5_Renno_NPC=It's a long story. Our king was king before…well, even before the Manacalon empire.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_Forge_6_Player_Default=He must be very…old.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_Forge_7_Renno_NPC=Yes, but you'd be wise not to mention that.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_Forge_8_Renno_NPC=Follow the corridors, use the minor gate.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_06_EndBattle_Forge_9_Renno_NPC=And…don't stare.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_Start_1_Player_Default=By all the gods, what is this place?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_Start_2_Player_Default=A tomb. A very large and very rich tomb.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_Start_3_Player_Default=Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_Start_4_Player_Default=Undead.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_Start_5_Player_Default=Big fat, ugly undead.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_Start_6_Player_Default=Come on! We're friends, aren't we?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_1_Hendeolas_NPC=Wherefore come ye here alone? Does not my descendant Ellaria bring ye?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_2_Player_Default=She left to take care of the dead rebels.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_3_Hendeolas_NPC=A vain effort, far beneath her trouble. Ah, well…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_4_Hendeolas_NPC=So ye… persons - be the myrmidons, the matchless soldiers of grand report?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_5_Player_Default=We are…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_6_Hendeolas_NPC=Hold thy tongue, slave!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_7_Hendeolas_NPC=Strange times these are, when a king must rely on such creatures as you to muster his armies.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_8_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Remain silent.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=We're not soldiers.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_10_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=You're just like Orenetis.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_11_Player_Default=We helped your rebellion of our own, free will. We're not your soldiers.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_12_Hendeolas_NPC=Is that so?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_13_Hendeolas_NPC=Did Ellaria commit a greater mistake than I expected?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_14_Hendeolas_NPC=Say one more word without being ordered to speak, and you will receive a lesson in respect!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_15_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Get lost!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_16_Player_Default=You don't seem any different from Orenetis. Just another slaver on a throne.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_17_Player_Default=You dare compared me to this upstart?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_18_Player_Default=This degenerate dragon!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_19_Player_Any=We won't exchange one tyrant for another!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_20_Hendeolas_NPC=The time has come for me to rise from my age-long slumber.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_21_Hendeolas_NPC=The usurper's weakness is found.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_22_Hendeolas_NPC=To the west it lies, in a hidden place where petty wizards toy with the valley's lesser creatures.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_23_Hendeolas_NPC=Therein will ye find his weakness.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_24_Hendeolas_NPC=In finding it shall you know it - even witlings as you are. Or know him, I should say.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_25_Hendeolas_NPC=The weakness slain, the place destroy'd, and this Orenetis shall be finished.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_meeting_26_Hendeolas_NPC=Then shall I release you to return to your homelands, on the word of a king.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_aftermeeting_1_Player_NPC=He's as bad as Orenetis!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_aftermeeting_2_Player_NPC=If not worse!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_aftermeeting_3_Player_NPC=Plus, he's…undead.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_aftermeeting_4_Player_NPC=Did you understand who we have to kill?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_aftermeeting_5_Player_NPC=We'll know him when we see him?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_aftermeeting_6_Player_NPC=We should have asked more questions.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_aftermeeting_7_Player_NPC=And stay… in there… for one more minute?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_aftermeeting_8_Player_NPC=Forget it!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_07_aftermeeting_9_Player_NPC=We have the map. Let's do this!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_1_Player_Default=It is done! Orenetis is no more!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_2_Hendeolas_NPC=Oh, most welcome tidings!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_3_Hendeolas_NPC=And what of the place that hid his weakness?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_4_Player_Default=Destroyed.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_5_Hendeolas_NPC=Most nobly done!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_6_Hendeolas_NPC=Yes, my mind wonders…
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_7_Hendeolas_NPC=…will such low creatures as you keep faith with me?
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_8_Player_Default=Of course!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_9_Hendeolas_NPC=Silence!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_10_Hendeolas_NPC=To all the world, I must remain long dead.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_11_Hendeolas_NPC=House Anfarel will rule again, but not through me.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_12_Hendeolas_NPC=I shall return to my slumber, and rise again if needed.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_13_Hendeolas_NPC=And let none of your Masgarth treasure hunters disturb my home!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_14_Player_Default=We'll never speak of you to anyone.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_15_Player_Default=You should worry more about Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_16_Player_Default=We could have betrayed you to support Orenetis. We did not.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_17_Hendeolas_NPC=Your words are empty.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_18_Hendeolas_NPC=The words of slaves!
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_19_Hendeolas_NPC=Very well.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_08_Start_20_Hendeolas_NPC=Take this. Craft this item, so the redeemers hinder you not when you leave the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_1_Samko_NPC=Clear skies!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_2_Player_Default=Bad news…we found their stuff.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_3_Player_Default=They're most likely dead, killed by roaming monsters.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_4_Samko_NPC=I was afraid so…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_5_Samko_NPC=You still earned your reward.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_6_Samko_NPC=Now…maybe you could help us with something else.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_7_Samko_NPC=A pack of wolves has been prowling around the camp.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_8_Samko_NPC=I need you to deal with them like we deal with winter wolves in the tundra.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_9_Player_Default=What, now?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_10_Samko_NPC=Kill them! If you drive them off, they'll just come back!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_11_Player_Default=Seems easy enough.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_02_12_Samko_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_1_Samko_NPC=I'm impressed!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_2_Samko_NPC=I'd have you at my back hunting remorhaz, for sure!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_3_Samko_NPC=Now, I have to tell you something…a secret.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_4_Samko_NPC=I've a friend in Caer Hyfryd - part of a small club of ours.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_5_Samko_NPC=When you get there, go to the inn and ask for Cafrain.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_6_Player_Default=What inn?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_7_Samko_NPC=The Merry Remorhaz, it's called!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_8_Samko_NPC=If you're looking for someone - or something - she can help.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_9_Player_Default=In exchange for?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_10_Samko_NPC=Same as you did for me, but probably higher stakes.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_03_11_Samko_NPC=Here's a letter for her! And give her my regards!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_1_Player_Default=Cafrain? We have a letter from Samko.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_2_Cafrain_NPC=That's me.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_3_Cafrain_NPC=Mmm. Quite an introduction!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_4_Player_Default=She seemed to appreciate our work!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_5_Cafrain_NPC=She has good instincts. You have to, as a huntress.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_6_Cafrain_NPC=And sometimes, you have to take a chance.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_7_Player_Default=A chance?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_8_Cafrain_NPC=Yes. Are you aware of the…shall we say, the dynamics of the Valley?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_9_Player_Default=The fact that your beloved Lord Protector isn't that beloved?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_10_Cafrain_NPC=Exactly! There are many who…oppose him.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_11_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=The Rebellion?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_12_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=The people?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_13_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=The Forge?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_14_Player_ChoiceA=We heard about a rebellion.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_15_Player_ChoiceB=The people seem unhappy with the Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_16_Player_ChoiceC=The Forge seems to be a force to be reckoned with…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_17_Cafrain_NPc=Indeed, but don't let them fool you…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_18_Cafrain_NPc=…in their own ways, they are as bad as Orenetis.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_19_Player_Default=How come?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_20_Cafrain_NPC=A thousand years after the Cataclysm, they still cling to the Manacalon ideal.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_21_Player_Default=Why do they oppose the Lord Protector, then?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_22_Cafrain_NPC=Because they think they are the true heirs of the Empire. Whatever that means.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_23_Cafrain_NPC=They mean well, and certainly they don't have it easy…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_24_Cafrain_NPC=…but they are weak, and not prepared to take decisive action…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_25_Cafrain_NPC=…they fear reprisals.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_26_Cafrain_NPC=The Forge has power, true enough!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_27_Player_Default=Why do I hear an unspoken 'but', there?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_28_Cafrain_NPC=Because there is one.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_29_Cafrain_NPC=The Forge is too interested in its business deals to risk everything by taking sides.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_30_Cafrain_NPC=They walk a tightrope the whole time, always hedging their bets…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_31_Cafrain_NPC=Seldom taking a gamble!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_32_Cafrain_NPC=They're not about to rock the boat.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_33_Player_Default=So critical of every group. Are you an independent?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_34_Cafrain_NPC=There's my gamble. Samko and I work for… another party.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_35_Player_NPC=And what makes this one different?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_36_Cafrain_NPC=Ever heard of us before?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_37_Cafrain_NPC=No, of course you haven't. But we've heard of you.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_38_Cafrain_NPC=And we will make of this Valley a better place for everybody!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_39_Cafrain_NPC=Except, of course, for the Lord Protector and his goons.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_40_Cafrain_NPC=And talking about goons…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_41_Player_Default=Yes?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_42_Cafrain_NPC=Well, do you want to help us?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_43_Cafrain_NPC=Then fetch a particular document from the Ice Princess' officers.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_44_Player_Default=The Ice Princess?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_45_Cafrain_NPC=Ever met Commander Malariel Brogarad?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_46_Player_Default=You have spies in the city guard?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_47_Cafrain_NPC=Don't ask too much too soon.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_48_Cafrain_NPC=Bring me the papers, and we'll talk more.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_49_Player_Default=We're kind of…unwelcome up there.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_50_Cafrain_NPC=Really? Shame.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_51_Cafrain_NPC=Well, if you find a way, we'll talk again.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_Read_1_Player_Default=It's blank! What does that mean?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_04_Read_2_Player_Default=Maybe it was just a test?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_1_Player_Default=Here, your…document.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_2_Cafrain_NPC=Thanks! Any problems along the way?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_3_Player_Default=Not at all.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_4_Player_Default=Your friend wasn't exactly talkative.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_5_Cafrain_NPC=Not his job.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_6_Cafrain_NPC=Are you planning to go back to the forest?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_7_Cafrain_NPC=I need this package delivered to Samko.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_8_Player_Default=Is it empty?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_9_Cafrain_NPC=What? Of course not!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_10_Player_Default=Will that make us part of the club?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_11_Cafrain_NPC=Soon.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_12_Cafrain_NPC=Good. Happy hunting!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_1_Samko_NPC=Looks like you met Cafrain.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_2_Player_Default=It felt more like a test than an actual job.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_3_Samko_NPC=She must have told you - we're cautious.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_4_Player_Default=Is your little club a real thing?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_5_Samko_NPC=Sure is. We walk in the shadows, masked, but we're real.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_6_Samko_NPC=Thanks for the message!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_05_End_7_Samko_NPC=Next time you see Cafrain, the real business will begin.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_1_Cafrain_NPC=Clear skies! I heard from Samko - Thanks for the delivery!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_2_Player_Default=We aim to please!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_3_Cafrain_NPC=I have another job for you.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_4_Cafrain_NPC=Something that will hurt the Dominion.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_5_Player_Default=So, we're in the club now?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_6_Cafrain_NPC=Yes, but stop calling it that.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_7_Player_Default=What should we call it, then?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_8_Cafrain_NPC=There's no real name. We're all hiding, masked, in the shadows.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_9_Player_Default=Masked?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_10_Cafrain_NPC=Do you want to hear about the job or not?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_11_Cafrain_NPC=Good. You know the Dominion has outposts spread across the Valley, to keep control of it?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_12_Cafrain_NPC=You're going to one of them.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_13_Player_Default=Any particular reason?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_14_Cafrain_NPC=The boss has a plan.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_15_Player_Default=Who's the boss?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_16_Cafrain_NPC=You really do like names, don't you?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_17_Player_Default=We just want to know what we're signing up for.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_18_Cafrain_NPC=Freedom. Take this banner and make it fly over the Feleg outpost.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_19_Cafrain_NPC=Good hunting!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_1_Player_Default=It's done - the outpost, the banner.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_2_Cafrain_NPC=Thank you for that.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_3_Player_Default=There's more, though…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_4_Cafrain_NPC=What?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_5_Player_Default=Turns out, the soldiers were rebels in disguise.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_6_Cafrain_NPC=Really?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_7_Player_Default=Yeah… to be honest, we feel used, a little.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_8_Cafrain_NPC=I'm sorry. I didn't know you were friends with the Rebellion.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_9_Player_Default=We can't go on without knowing who you really are.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_10_Cafrain_NPC=Of course. It's time you knew.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_11_Cafrain_NPC=We follow Vando Klarn, herald of Misaye.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_12_Player_Default=Misaye, the Lady of Luck?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_13_Cafrain_NPC=Yes! And soon you will have proved yourselves sufficiently…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_14_Cafrain_NPC=…for me to introduce you to our leader.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_15_Player_Default=And when will that be?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_16_Cafrain_NPC=Come back tomorrow. I'll have a new mission for you.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_06_End_15_Cafrain_NPC=In the meantime, remember - Misaye kissed you today!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_1_Cafrain_NPC=Still laughing, friends? I have another job for you!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_2_Player_Default=Another bad apple?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_3_Cafrain_NPC=Alas, no…This is a plan to stir the people up against Orenetis…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_4_Cafrain_NPC=…to make him show his dark side, so the people see who he really is…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_5_Player_Default=How do you plan to achieve that?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_6_Cafrain_NPC=There are some incriminating documents.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_7_Player_Default=Incriminating against whom?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_8_Cafrain_NPC=Doesn't matter!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_9_Player_Default=What does matter, then?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_10_Cafrain_NPC=What matters is that those documents are found at the Merry Remorhaz…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_11_Player_Default=That would be very bad for the Innkeeper!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_12_Cafrain_NPC=Karelia Snowfox is well-liked in the city. Her arrest could sway the people in our favor.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_13_Player_Default=A bold move!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_14_Cafrain_NPC=We are in Misaye's hands! Roll the dice and see what happens!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_1_Cafrain_NPC=Well done!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_2_Player_Default=It wasn't hard at all.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_3_Cafrain_NPC=Good, then!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_4_Cafrain_NPC=Vando Klarn is expecting you.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_07_End_5_Cafrain_NPC=Near the city's entrance, turn left. Behind the Dominion banner, you'll find a door.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_1_Klarn_NPC=Well met!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_2_Player_Default=So, you are Vando Klarn?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_3_Klarn_NPC=Guilty as charged.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_4_Player_Default=Are you going to enlighten us about your goals here?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_5_Klarn_NPC=Misaye has a design for this valley, and I am but her messenger!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_6_Player_Default=Ah - a man on a mission!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_7_Klarn_NPC=Not in the way you think!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_8_Klarn_NPC=Misaye loves freedom, and people like Orenetis are anathema to her!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_9_Player_Default=He's powerful, though. What's your plan?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_10_Klarn_NPC=At first it felt as hopless as catching Misaye herself - but Thanks to Cafrain, Samko, you, and some others…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_11_Klarn_NPC=…this holy mission is more than a forlorn hope!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_12_Klarn_NPC=The strategy is simple: divide and conquer!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_13_Player_Default=And our role?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_14_Klarn_NPC=Right now, I need you to find me a way into the Rebellion's headquarters.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_15_Klarn_NPC=I have a map that should lead you there, but I need a thorough reconaissance.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_16_Player_If_Rebel_HQ_already_visited=Well, we've been there already.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_17_Klarn_NPC=Ah! The Lady is smiling on us!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_18_Klarn_NPC=I need to plan our next move based on this information.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_19_Klarn_NPC=We'll talk tomorrow. You're welcome to stay here and use our hidden network through the city.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_20_Player_If_Rebel_HQ_not_visited=We're on it!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_21_Player_Default=Before we go…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_22_Player_Default=…are you Marin Ving?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_23_Klarn_NPC=I am…a simple servant of Misaye!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_24_Klarn_NPC=Sweet laughter to you!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_25_Player_Default=That's definitely him!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_26_Player_Default=So what? - we grab him and drag him to Helia Fairblade?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_27_Player_Default=Like we could!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_08_28_Player_Default=If we help him overthrow Orenetis, maybe we'll get out of the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_1_Klarn_NPC=My friends - I had an interesting visit!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_2_Player_Default=Pray tell!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_3_Klarn_NPC=Our Lady of Luck has granted me a vision!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_4_Klarn_NPC=Unworthy as I am, she favored me!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_5_Player_Default=And what was this vision about?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_6_Klarn_NPC=I saw a cave, near the Forge camp where you first met Samko Flint.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_7_Klarn_NPC=Within there is an abandoned sanctuary, where Misaye was worshiped long ago.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_8_Klarn_NPC=Go there, and clear the way for me.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_9_Klarn_NPC=Her Whimsical Majesty has commanded me to re-consecrate this holy place.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_10_Player_Default=A cave - that's pretty vague.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_11_Klarn_NPC=I saw it clearly. I'll mark it on your map.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_12_Player_Default=Misaye is laughing!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_13_Player_Default=I think we found it, but we couldn't get inside.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_14_Klarn_NPC=That is great news! Then it's just waiting for me!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_15_Player_Default=We found the temple. It's closed - magically.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_16_Klarn_NPC=Yes, I know.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_17_Klarn_NPC=Re-consecrating a temple, or just re-dedicating it, -it's no small thing.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_18_Klarn_NPC=The forces that desecrated it may still be there.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_19_Player_Default=So you need bodyguards?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_20_Klarn_NPC=Yes!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_21_Player_Default=Given that your life is in the balance, and it seems you really need us…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_22_Klarn_NPC=Fine! I know what you're going to ask!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_23_Klarn_NPC=Yes, I am Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_24_Player_Default=Can't believe it!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_25_Player_Default=I was starting to think you were just a fable.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_26_Player_Default=Or a Sorak.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_27_Klarn_NPC=Oh, please…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_28_Klarn_NPC=So, let's make a deal!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_29_Klarn_NPC=Help me rid this valley of Orenetis and I'll go back to Masgarth with you.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_30_Klarn_NPC=As the new…ruler of the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_31_Player_Default=Sounds like you want diplomatic immunity or something.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_32_Klarn_NPC=Well, our dear Princess wouldn't arrest the leader of a neighboring, sovereign state.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_33_Klarn_NPC=Not in time of war.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_34_Player_Default=We could just take you back by force.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_35_Klarn_NPC=But you won't.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_36_Klarn_NPC=Ah, Misaye's laughing at me now…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_37_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=We will.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_09_38_Player_Any=Just watch us!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_1_Klarn_NPC=Yes, this is it!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_2_Player_Default=What's going on?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_3_Klarn_NPC=The goddess has spoken!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_4_Klarn_NPC=The moment is upon us! The people are enraged and the rebellion in disarray!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_5_Player_Default=So?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_6_Klarn_NPC=This is our chance to overthrow the tyrant!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_7_Player_Default=You mean, attack the palace and kill Orenetis?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_8_Klarn_NPC=He won't just surrender, I can promise you that!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_9_Player_If_SecretAccess_Known=As it happens, we know a way into the palace.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_10_Klarn_NPC=Wonderful news! Misaye smiles upon us!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_11_Player_If_SecretAccess_Not_Known=Let's stock up on healing potions!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_12_Klarn_NPC=A true believer!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_13_Klarn_NPC=Misaye shall kiss us all!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_14_Player_Default=Aye, I am a true believer - in being prepared!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_15_Player_Default=Misaye is laughing enough at us as it is!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_16_Klarn_NPC=And so she is!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_17_Klarn_NPC=Once you're facing him, I'll join you for the fight.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_18_Klarn_NPC=How will you do that? Teleporting?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_19_Klarn_NPC=It's a secret.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_1_Player_Default=Looks like we did it!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_2_Player_Default=Why do you think of that, Ving?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_3_Klarn_NPC=It's "my Lord Protector" now - even to you!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_4_Player_Default=What?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_5_Klarn_NPC=Ha! You should have seen your face!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_6_Klarn_NPC=But please, show some respect when addressing me in public.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_7_Klarn_NPC=I am the Lord Protector now! And I pledge that I will to keep the people safe!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_8_Player_Default=The same title as Orenetis. That's a debatable choice…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_9_Player_Default=…Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_10_Klarn_NPC=Touché. Well, people don't like big changes.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_11_Player_Default=About pledges - you said you'd come back to the Principality with us?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_12_Klarn_NPC=True - and I wish I could do that…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_13_Klarn_NPC=…but after thinking it through, I'm afraid that's impossible.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_14_Player_Default=What? Why?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_15_Klarn_NPC=I have responsibilities here in the Valley. I can't just leave - there would be civil war!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_16_Player_Default=Buy you gave us your word!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_17_Klarn_NPC=My word as a citizen, yes - but now I am a ruler! But you are free to return to Masgarth.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_18_Klarn_NPC=I forgot to tell you - I found out how Orenetis controlled armies of redeemers.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_19_Klarn_NPC=He's taken their… queen as a sort of hostage.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_20_Klarn_NPC=He has a scepter that will keep redeemers at bay. Here - take it!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_21_Player_Default=And leave you as the new Lord Protector?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_22_Klarn_NPC=Is that a problem?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_23_Player_Default=We're supposed to take you back.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_24_Klarn_NPC=To whom? Are you not free to make your own decisions, as Misaye decrees?
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=We'll tell the Church and the Principality.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_26_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=We'll only tell the Church of Misaye.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_27_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=You're coming, dead or alive!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_28_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=We'll say we didn't find you.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_29_Player_ChoiceA=We'll tell the truth to the authorities.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_30_Klarn_NPC=I'm sure the Princess will welcome diplomatic relations with the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_31_Klarn_NPC=I hear there are still Soraks out there…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_32_Klarn_NPC=…and the Principality is on the brink of war.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_33_Klarn_NPC=And please take my salutations to my disciple in Caer Cyflen, Leyrin Catpaw.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_34_Player_ChoiceB=All right. We'll only tell the Church of Misaye.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_35_Klarn_NPC=Fine, as you wish.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_36_Player_ChoiceC=No way! If you won't come willingly…
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_37_Klarn_NPC=Ohhh, you're no fun!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_38_Player_ChoiceD=After all this we just want to go home. We never found you.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_39_Klarn_NPC=Stay neutral - a wise strategy!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_40_Player_Default=Then I guess it's time for us to go.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_41_Player_Default=Let's find this scepter and go home.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_1_Player_Default=Are you the Lord Protector's assistant?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_2_Lysantir_NPC=Ehhh - I guess so.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_3_Player_Default=Are you in shock or something? Did they torture you?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_4_Lysantir_NPC=No, no - nothing like that. I was just wondering…who you were.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_5_Player_Default=The Lord Protector sent us to find you.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_6_Lysantir_NPC=Oh - that's nice of him!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_7_Player_Default=What's wrong?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_8_Lysantir_NPC=I'd prefer not to go back to Caer Hyfryd.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_9_Player_Default=Why not?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_10_Lysantir_NPC=I have developed… other interests.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_11_Player_Default=Like being a prisoner?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_12_Lysantir_NPC=I like the outdoors.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_13_Lysantir_NPC=I could stay in the swamp - just not in a cage.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_14_Player_Default=We'll see about that. Let's move out!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_15_Player_Default=Who are you?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_16_Lysantir_NPC=My name is Lysantir.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_17_Lysantir_NPC=Thank you for freeing me.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_18_Player_Default=Are you going to be fine on your own?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_05_FoundLysantir_19_Lysantir_NPC=Oh, yes.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_1_Player_Default=Who is…
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_2_Player_Default=Orenetis?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_3_Sitenero_NPC=Please - I'm not him! Not really…
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_4_Player_Default=What's going on, here?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_5_Sitenero_NPC=Let me explain.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_6_Sitenero_NPC=My name is Sitenero - or at least, I think it is.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_7_Player_Default=What?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_8_Sitenero_NPC=It's a long story.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_9_Player_Default=We pretty much cleared the place out, so please - enlighten us.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_10_Sitenero_NPC=Well…I am…was…a researcher of the Manacalon Arcaneum.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_11_Sitenero_NPC=My field of work is…hybridization.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_12_Player_Default=By all the gods! You mean - all those monsters in here… and in the swamp?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_13_Sitenero_NPC=Yes. They were my work, before… well, before I was imprisoned.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_14_Player_Default=So why do you look exactly like Orenetis?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_15_Sitenero_NPC=Well, he and I, we were a single person.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_16_Sitenero_NPC=When the Magister called us to fight at the Rift, we refused.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_17_Sitenero_NPC=We weren't bound to him like the Masters were.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_18_Sitenero_NPC=But then…the Cataclysm…
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_19_Sitenero_NPC=…we felt the mana collapsing…
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_20_Sitenero_NPC=…changed our form to elf to avoid… well, death.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_21_Sitenero_NPC=But something happened as we changed - some violent fluctuation.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_22_Sitenero_NPC=We ended up as… well - two elves instead of one.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_23_Player_Default=Oh…
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_24_Sitenero_NPC=Orenetis is…passionate, hedonistic - some would say sociopathic.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_25_Player_Default=Really? I can't say I'd noticed!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_26_Sitenero_NPC=I guess you could say he's the bad half of us.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_27_Sitenero_NPC=As for me, I considered myself rational, reasonable, and quite sympathetic.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_28_Player_Default=Don't forget modest.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_29_Player_Default=Did he put you here?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_30_Sitenero_NPC=Oh, yes!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_31_Player_Default=Why?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_32_Sitenero_NPC=Well, he must know that we could reunite, and become one again.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_33_Sitenero_NPC=He…doesn't want that.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_34_Sitenero_NPC=I think he likes being who he is.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_35_Player_Default=A sociopath, you mean. So he locked you up instead?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_36_Sitenero_NPC=He did. But I don't think he can simply kill me, because…
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_37_Sitenero_NPC=…well, maybe I shouldn't say…
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_38_Player_Default=Let me guess. Hurting you would hurt him too?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_39_Sitenero_NPC=Um…yes.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_40_Player_Default=So if we kill you, we kill him?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_41_Sitenero_NPC=But reuniting us would be better - and not just for me.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_42_Player_Default=He won't allow it, you said.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_43_Sitenero_NPC=He would need convincing, certainly. Or forcing.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_44_Sitenero_NPC=Reunited, we would make a much wiser, kinder - better leader for the people of the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_45_Player_Default=A tough decision.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_46_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Let's kill him! (Fails People quests)
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_47_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Come with us (Fails Rebellion and Mask quests)
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_48_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=You should go free. (Fails Rebellion and People quests)
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_49_Player_ChoiceA=Think about it - we kill him and Orenetis is gone!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_50_Player_Default=There's no decision to make!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_51_Player_ChoiceB=Come with us. We'll make a plan once we're out of here.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_52_Sitenero_NPC=Fine with me.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_53_Player_ChoiceC=That's none of our business. You're free to go.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_54_Player_Default=Thank you!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_55_Player_MaskAgent=This is a landslide for the Mask!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_01_56_Player_RebellionAgent=In the name of Hendeolas Anfarel, we sentence you to die!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_1_Player_Default=What is this? A giant…village?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_2_Player_Default=He doesn't seem hostile.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_3_Player_Default=I speak Giant. Let's try.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_4_Gartok_NPC=Hello, little ones!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_5_Player_Default=What are you doing here?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_6_Gartok_NPC=Trading.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_7_Player_Default=Giants conduct trade?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_8_Gartok_NPC=I do.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_9_Gartok_NPC=Need direwolf pelts and large feathers, plenty.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_10_Player_Default=We might be able to find that.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_11_Gartok_NPC=Then we trade.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_12_Player_Default=I thought giants were all stupid.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_13_Player_Default=Maybe someone cast a spell on it.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_01_14_Player_Default=Too bad we don't speak giant.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_1_Gartok_NPC=You found…good!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_2_Gartok_NPC=Give you gold.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_3_Gartok_NPC=Need something from city but people hate us.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_4_Player_Default=What do you need from the city?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_5_Gartok_NPC=Sewing kit.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_6_Player_Default=A what?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_7_Player_Default=Don't judge.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_8_Player_Default=We could probably get that for you.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_9_Gartok_NPC=Pay you with pack of meat.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_10_Gartok_NPC=Dried meat of ape, dwarves love it.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_11_Player_Default=I think I heard that somewhere.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_12_Player_Default=See you, Gartok.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_02_13_Gartok_NPC=Bye, little ones!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_1_Gartok_NPC=Good - yes, good!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_2_Gartok_NPC=Thank you, little ones.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_3_Gartok_NPC=Just need big flat rock, now.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_4_Player_Default=Why do you need all these things?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_5_Gartok_NPC=Making a chair.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_6_Player_Default=Wait, you want a big flat rock? We already found one.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_7_Player_Default=Near the cave, over there.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_8_Gartok_NPC=Great. Me getting that now.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_9_Player_Default=So you need something you could sit on?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_10_Gartok_NPC=You friends of Gartok, invited in camp.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_03_11_Gartok_NPC=Beware other giants.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_1_Gartok_NPC=Friends worried.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_2_Player_Default=Why is that?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_3_Gartok_NPC=Friends disappeared.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_4_Player_Default=How many giants live here?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_5_Gartok_NPC=Eight.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_6_Gartok_NPC=Need to ask city people if saw them.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_7_Player_Default=We can do that.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_8_Player_Default=Hey, Gartok!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_9_Player_Default=We asked around the city. There's no trace of your friends.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_10_Gartok_NPC=Oh. Yes. Remember. Friends gone to swamp.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_11_Player_Default=So, not to the city? Got it.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_1_Player_Default=Sorry, we learned that your friends were attacked.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_2_Player_Default=But look who's here!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_3_Gartok_NPC=Rugan!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_4_Rugan_NPC=Gartok!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_5_Rugan_NPC=Makers got Hogar back to prison.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_6_Gartok_NPC=No! Bad news!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_7_Player_Default=What was that?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_8_Gartok_NPC=Gartok and friends born in maker prison.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_9_Gartok_NPC=Escaped before medication.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_10_Rugan_NPC=Medication bad.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_11_Player_Default=Makes sense.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_12_Gartok_NPC=You find makers, find Hogar.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_13_Player_Default=What's this maker story?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_14_Player_Default=Maybe they have been made intelligent by someone.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_15_Player_Default=With medication?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_End_16_Player_Default=A potion of permanent intelligence increase?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_1_Player_Default=What are you doing here?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_2_Scientist_NPC=Research. I tested potions all night.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_3_Player_Default=What's wrong with you?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_4_Scientist_NPC=I'm sick - potion fumes.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_5_Scientist_NPC=I have a medication, I just can't find it.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_6_Player_Default=What does it look like?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_7_Scientist_NPC=It's a…well, a potion.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_8_Player_Default=Figures…
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_9_Scientist_NPC=It's a blue vial.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_End_1_Scientist_NPC=You found it!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_End_2_Scientist_NPC=You saved me!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_End_3_Scientist_NPC=I have to sleep now.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_01_End_4_Scientist_NPC=Feel free to use the beds.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_1_Player_Default=What are you doing in this place?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_2_Scientist2_NPC=We're…testing subjects.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_3_Player_Default=What subjects?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_4_Scientist2_NPC=I'm sorry, I have no time.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_5_Scientist2_NPC=I need to find this damn book!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_6_Player_Default=What book?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_7_Scientist2_NPC=It's called The Dreiglath Codex.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_8_Player_Default=Sounds like a real page-turner.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_9_Scientist2_NPC=It's a magical-scientific text.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_10_Scientist2_NPC=If you find it, I'll tell you more about what we do.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_1_Player_Default=Is this your book?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_2_Scientist2_NPC=Oh, Thanks!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_3_Player_Default=Care to tell us more now?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_4_Scientist2_NPC=Oh, sure!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_5_Scientist2_NPC=We test the performance of hybrid monsters.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_6_Scientist2_NPC=Specifically their combat capabilities and their obedience.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_7_Player_Default=Hybrid?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_8_Scientist2_NPC=Right. We mix two species and create something new.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_9_Player_Default=That's unnatural!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_10_Scientist2_NPC=Of course not, it happens all the time in nature.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_02_End_11_Scientist2_NPC=We just…push it a little.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_1_Player_Default=What are you doing?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_2_Scientist3_NPC=Staying alive - or trying to!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_3_Scientist3_NPC=Since we can't stop this.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_4_Player_Default=Stop what?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_5_Scientist3_NPC=We need the Lord Protector!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_6_Scientist3_NPC=Only him can fight these…things.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_7_Player_Default=He sent us to fix the Major Gate.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_8_Scientist3_NPC=Well, the mana flow is cut, so, no gating.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_9_Player_Default=How do we fix it?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_10_Scientist3_NPC=Fix it? You'd need to reach the generators.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_11_Scientist3_NPC=Good luck with that!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_12_Player_Default=We'll do it!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_13_Scientist3_NPC=Well, if you make it, take this note to my colleagues there.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_14_Scientist3_NPC=They might be able to help you with the procedure.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_end_1_Player_Default=Can you tell us how to fix the mana flow?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_end_2_Scientist3_NPC=Well, one of the generators seems to be out.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_end_3_Scientist3_NPC=You need to re-start it manually.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_end_4_Player_Default=How do we do that?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_03_end_5_Scientist3_NPC=If you just need to get there, it's just pulling up a lever.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_04_1_ComplexGuard_NPC=Waiting for them to come out.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_04_2_Player_Default=Who?
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_04_3_ComplexGuard_NPC=Test subjects! They escaped from the arena somehow!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_04_4_ComplexGuard_NPC=They're everywhere in the tunnels! We've lost a lot of elves already!
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_04_5_Player_Default=We need to get to the vault.
Narration/&DLC1_Complex_04_6_ComplexGuard_NPC=You're welcome to try. It'll help us if you can clear the way.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_1_Player_Default=This place is bigger than I thought!
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_2_Player_Default=Magic! Careful, everyone!
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Inside_1_Player_Default=All the doors are closed.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Inside_2_Player_Default=I see no sign of witchery.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Inside_3_Player_Default=Did you hear that?
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Locked_1_Player_Default=No one here.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Locked_2_Player_Default=This is magically sealed.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Ghost_1_Ghost_NPC=Please!
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Ghost_2_Player_Default=Damn! A ghost!
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Ghost_3_Ghost_NPC=Don't be scared!

Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Ghost_5_Player_Default=Who are…were you?
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Ghost_6_Ghost_NPC=Joson. I was killed by the witch.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Ghost_7_Player_Default=A witch?
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Ghost_8_Ghost_NPC=I'm cursed to say no more.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Ghost_9_Ghost_NPC=Ask my brother Hannik in Caer Hyfryd. He's a performer at the music hall.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Ghost_10_Player_Default=That was weird.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_1_Player_Default=Are you Hannik?
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_2_Hannik_NPC=That's me!
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_3_Player_Default=Bad news, I'm afraid. We found your brother's ghost in the swamps.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_4_Hannik_NPC=Oh, no!
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_5_Hannik_NPC=I told him not to…
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_6_Player_Default=He says he was killed by a witch. Do you know anything about that?
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_7_Hannik_NPC=Yes…he was hunting her.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_8_Hannik_NPC=Said he found the password to her palace.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_9_Player_Default=Palace?
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_10_Hannik_NPC=He kept repeating, 'hail Agatha, spider queen'.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_11_Player_Default=Well, that's more of a pass-phrase.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_12_Player_Default=We'll try to avenge your brother, Hannik.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Hannik_13_Hannik_NPC=Thank you, friends.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_MeetWitch_1_Witch_NPC=Welcome, strangers!

Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Revealed_1_Witch_NPC=Manners maketh man, you know.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Revealed_2_Witch_NPC=You were told not to rummage through my things!
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Revealed_3_Player_Default=Agatha, is it?
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Revealed_4_Witch_NPC=Your souls will wander through the swamp forever!
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Conclusion_1_Player_Default=This is for you. Proof that the witch was real.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Conclusion_2_Hannik_NPC=You avenged him!
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Conclusion_3_Hannik_NPC=I don't know how to Thank you!

Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Truth_1_Player_Default=By all the gods, what is this place?
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Truth_2_Player_Default=I'm pretty sure she didn't want us to see that.
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_1_ForgeGuard_NPC=Stay away from the prisoner!
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_2_Player_Default=Why are you keeping a giant as a prisoner?
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_3_ForgeGuard_NPC=Hasdrubal's orders.
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_4_Hasdrubal_NPC=Yes, this giant is too smart to go free…
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_5_Hasdrubal_NPC=…and too dangerous.
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_6_Player_Default=If you don't want to kill him, you should set him free!
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_7_Hasdrubal_NPC=It's cruel to keep him there.
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_8_Hasdrubal_NPC=I can't take that risk.
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_9_Hasdrubal_NPC=Fine, he walks, but I'll hold you responsible if he hurts anyone.
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_Free_1_Rugan_NPC=Thank you little ones.
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_Free_2_Player_Default=Are you Gartok's friend?

Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_Escape_3_ForgeGuard_NPC=Guards!
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_Escape_4_ForgeGuard_NPC=They freed the giant!
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_Escape_5_Hasdrubal_NPC=You have no authority to do that! This is our camp!
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_Escape_6_Player_Default=You had no right to keep him prisoner!
Narration/&DLC1_Swamp_Prisoner_Escape_7_Hasdrubal_NPC=I thought you were smarter than that!
Narration/&DLC1_Karelia_Inn_1_Karelia_NPC=Clear skies, adventurers!

Narration/&DLC1_Karelia_Inn_12_Player_Default=How are things around here?
Narration/&DLC1_Karelia_Inn_13_Karelia_NPC=The usual. Soldiers making trouble…
Narration/&DLC1_Karelia_Inn_14_Karelia_NPC=…nobles coming down to bully my clients.
Narration/&DLC1_Karelia_Inn_15_Karelia_NPC=Backed-up by His Lordship the Non-Protector.

Narration/&DLC1_Meeting3_3_Finaliel_NPC=And don't eat near the books.
Narration/&DLC1_Hello1_4_Finaliel_NPC=I doubt you have the skills to use my laboratory.
Narration/&DLC1_Hello2_5_Finaliel_NPC=What did you craft already? A potion to regrow hair?

Narration/&DLC1_Meeting_1_Sima_NPC=Try that again and I'll kill you.
Narration/&DLC1_FactionOpposed_2_Sima_NPC=I know who you serve, lackeys.
Narration/&DLC1_FactionOpposed_3_Sima_NPC=Leave me be!
Narration/&DLC1_Hello1_4_Sima_NPC=Clear skies!
Narration/&DLC1_Hello2_5_Sima_NPC=Strike true, friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Random1_6_Sima_NPC=I like it near the fire.
Narration/&DLC1_Random2_7_Sima_NPC=This place could be so much better…
Narration/&DLC1_Meeting_1_Ellaria_NPC=If you're so desperate for gold, just ask.
Narration/&DLC1_Hello1_2_Ellaria_NPC=Stay true!
Narration/&DLC1_Hello2_3_Ellaria_NPC=We keep watch.
Narration/&DLC1_Random1_4_Ellaria_NPC=The rebellion will soon rise.
Narration/&DLC1_Random2_5_Ellaria_NPC=The tyrant will fall, eventually.
Narration/&DLC1_Meeting_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=A stupid thing to do.
Narration/&DLC1_FactionOpposed_2_Hasdrubal_NPC=Stay away. I won't do business with you.
Narration/&DLC1_FactionOpposed_3_Hasdrubal_NPC=Don't do anything stupid!
Narration/&DLC1_Hello1_4_Hasdrubal_NPC=Clear skies!
Narration/&DLC1_Hello2_5_Hasdrubal_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC1_Random1_6_Hasdrubal_NPC=Business is hard, but we're still here!
Narration/&DLC1_Random2_7_Hasdrubal_NPC=The swamp stinks, but at least we're free!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_Rose_1_Player_Default=We're looking for…giants.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_Rose_2_Rose_NPC=What? Giants?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_Rose_3_Player_Default=A bunch of them, probably more intelligent than most…
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_Rose_4_Player_Default=…they'd be roaming around.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_Rose_5_Rose_NPC=I haven't heard of one giant, so…a bunch?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_04_Rose_6_Player_Default=It was worth a try.
Narration/&DLC1_Meeting_1_Renno_NPC=Hello, mates! Name's Renno Highwater.
Narration/&DLC1_Meeting_2_Renno_NPC=I'm at the helm here - weapons, potions, you name it.
Narration/&DLC1_Meeting_3_Renno_NPC=You need something, you come to me!
Narration/&DLC1_FactionOpposed_4_Renno_NPC=That ship has sailed, mates.
Narration/&DLC1_FactionOpposed_5_Renno_NPC=I don't talk to turncoats.
Narration/&DLC1_Hello1_6_Renno_NPC=Fair winds, mates!
Narration/&DLC1_Hello2_7_Renno_NPC=The storm'll pass.
Narration/&DLC1_Random1_8_Renno_NPC=I miss the sun and the wind, stuck down here.
Narration/&DLC1_Random2_9_Renno_NPC=Someday I'll sail away.
Narration/&DLC1_Meeting_1_Hanno_NPC=I'm Hanno Mudstrider.
Narration/&DLC1_FactionOpposed_2_Hanno_NPC=Shop's closed.
Narration/&DLC1_FactionOpposed_3_Hanno_NPC=Not selling to you.
Narration/&DLC1_Hello1_4_Hanno_NPC=Hey.
Narration/&DLC1_Hello2_5_Hanno_NPC=Yep.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=Thanks again for your help with the Rebellion!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_2_Player_Default=That's what friends are for!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_3_Hasdrubal_NPC=Now that we're family, there's something I need to tell you.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_4_Hasdrubal_NPC=We actually settled because we found a Minor Gate.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_5_Player_Academic=And it wasn't locked?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_6_Hasdrubal_NPC=No - and it gave us access to an area where we found enormous riches!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_7_Player_Academic=A treasure trove of lore, I gather!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_8_Hasdrubal_NPC=Not only that! Materials, recipes…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_9_Hasdrubal_NPC=But we've only explored a small part.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_10_Hasdrubal_NPC=We were deterred by the guardians that the place's Manacalon owners left behind.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_11_Player_Default=What kind of guardians?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_12_Hasdrubal_NPC=My people reported at least one greater elemental.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_13_Player_Academic=Not something you feel ready to face, I suppose.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_14_Hasdrubal_NPC=There's no rush, and I'd understand if you felt it was too much - even for you.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_15_Player_Default=Tell us where the Gate is. We'll prepare and go when we're ready.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=Greetings! Are you done?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_2_Player_Default=Yes! The place is now secure.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_3_Player_Default=It's full of stuff left behind by this wizard.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_4_Player_Default=You'll love it!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_5_Player_Default=There's one door that we couldn't open.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_6_Player_Default=So there's no way to know what's on the other side.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_7_Player_Default=We know where it leads.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_8_Player_Default=To the headquarters of the Rebellion.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_9_Hasdrubal_NPC=Oh… that might be a problem.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_1_Hasdrubal_NPC=Things have been heating up in the Valley!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_2_Hasdrubal_NPC=And Orenetis seems quite upset!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_3_Player_Default=Well, yes! He doesn't like upstart newcomers apparently!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_4_Hasdrubal_NPC=We found a heavily protected building, deep in the swamps.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_5_Hasdrubal_NPC=Orenetis' best troops are stationed there.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_6_Hasdrubal_NPC=According to our contacts in town, it's where he conducts his most secret experiments.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_7_Player_Default=Let's go! It's time we got some answers!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_8_Hasdrubal_NPC=Answers to what?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_9_Player_Default=The question of whether our beloved Lord Protector…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_10_Player_Default=…is really a protector…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_11_Player_Default=…or something more sinister!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_12_Hasdrubal_NPC=The Forge is with you!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_13_Player_Default=We'll take all the blessings we can get!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_5_End_1_Player_Default=Hey, Gartok!
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_5_End_2_Gortek_NPC=Little friends.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_5_End_3_Player_Default=We're sorry, we found your friend in the makers prison.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_5_End_4_Player_Default=He was dead.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_5_End_5_Gortek_NPC=Oh, sad. Medication did that, sure.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_5_End_6_Player_Default=That is probably the case, yes.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_FreeRugan_1_Rugan_NPC=Little ones, help me.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_FreeRugan_2_Player_Default=You speak?
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_FreeRugan_3_Rugan_NPC=Name is Rugan.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_FreeRugan_4_Rugan_NPC=Other little ones caught me.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_FreeRugan_5_Rugan_NPC=Rugan nice giant.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_FreeRugan_6_Player_Default=We could lead you away from here.
Narration/&DLC1_Giant_FreeRugan_7_Rugan_NPC=Yes!
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_1_Klarn_NPC=Looks like you've made enemies of pretty much everyone around.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_2_Klarn_NPC=Let me introduce myself.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_3_Klarn_NPC=My name is Marin Ving.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_4_Klarn_NPC=And here's my offer:
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_5_Klarn_NPC=I give you everything I know about the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_6_Klarn_NPC=You get me rid of the Lord Protector.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_7_Klarn_NPC=Steal his secret to pass the redeemer's nest.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_8_Klarn_NPC=And you leave me be.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_9_Klarn_NPC=Like you had a choice.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_Backup_10_Klarn_NPC=Well then I doubt you ever see the Principality again.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_1_Orenetis_NPC=Do you think I take pleasure in asking strangers to enforce my law, Malariel?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_2_Orenetis_NPC=Yes, yes…I have need of you again.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_3_Orenetis_NPC=Rebellion is spreading in my own city…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_4_Orenetis_NPC=…I get reports of sedition, sabotage…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_5_Orenetis_NPC=…I know where this happens.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_6_Orenetis_NPC=In that damn house of debauchery, the Merry Remorhaz!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_7_Orenetis_NPC=Go there and arrest the Innkeeper - a dwarf, I think.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_8_Orenetis_NPC=Bring her to Malariel.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_9_Orenetis_NPC=If she resists…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_10_Orenetis_NPC=…well, you know what to do.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_11_Orenetis_NPC=No one denies my authority.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_12_Orenetis_NPC=NO ONE!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_13_Any_Selfpres=Can we agree that he's crazy?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_14_Any_Friendly=He's getting worse, for sure.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_15_Any_Selfpres=We're going to end up hated by everyone but him.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_16_Any_Pragmatic=This doesn't really help our mission, so far.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_17_Any_Sneaky=Let's not talk about this in here.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_1_Orenetis_NPC=You?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_2_Orenetis_NPC=How did you…?
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_3_Sitenero_NPC=I'm here, and that's all that matters.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_4_Orenetis_NPC=I should have known outsiders would only betray me!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_5_Sitenero_NPC=We need to become one again, you know it.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_6_Orenetis_NPC=No!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_7_Sitenero_NPC=The valley is in a state of civil war. Surely that's not what you want.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_8_Orenetis_NPC=You don't even know what will happen if we do that!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_9_Sitenero_NPC=Let's find out!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_10_Orenetis_NPC=I would rather die!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_11_Orenetis_NPC=Fine. I agree.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_12_United_NPC=It worked! I am… one, again!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_13_Orenetis_NPC=Still, I'm an elf, not a dragon.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_14_Orenetis_NPC=But surely, the many scholars of Solasta can help me become what I once was.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_15_Orenetis_NPC=You've done well, strangers.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_16_Orenetis_NPC=Take this. It will allow you to walk through the redeemers' nest.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_17_Orenetis_NPC=Tell your people back home that we agree to open a diplomatic channel.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_18_Orenetis_NPC=I must rest, now. I have much to ponder.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_19_Player_Persuasion=Come on! You need this - you know it!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_20_Player_Intimidation=You don't have a choice. Look around you - we won!
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_21_Player_Deception=We saw the documents in your complex.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_22_Player_Deception=You and Sitenero are both degenerating.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_23_WRITTEN_Persuasion=It's in your own interests to agree.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_24_WRITTEN_Intimidation=If you refuse, we kill you.
Narration/&DLC1_Sitenero_Orenetis_25_WRITTEN_Deception=If you refuse, you'll degenerate and die.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Forge_Guard_01=Sorry. I can't let you in.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Forge_Guard_02=You may enter. Be careful, though. This creature is dangerous.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Forge_Guard_03=The prisoner escaped!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Forge_Guard_04=This is gonna fall on me…
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Marin_Ving_01=Take this key. I'll meet you inside.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Marin_Ving_02=Meet me at the secret base back in the city.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Forge_Guard_00=Sorry, I'm busy right now. Talk to Hasdrubal.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Rugan_00=Rugan sad! Rugan prisoner!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Rugan_01=Rugan locked by chains!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Rugan_02=I'll see you at our camp in the valley.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End8_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=You can have it.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_05_End9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=We want to keep it.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Swamp_01=Something's blocking the fence.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Swamp_02=Let's find another way out of the camp.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Swamp_03=I think we should avoid being seen running away with the prisoner.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Swamp_04=I guess a giant won't fit on that bridge. We need to find another way out!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Rose_01=I hope you enjoy the city!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Rose_02=Sorry, I'm busy right now.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Orenetis_01=I'm busy. Come back later.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Orenetis_02=This is looking good!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Reya_01=Sorry, I can't talk right now.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Reya_02=Thank you for your help!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Giant_01=Gartok ?
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Giant_02=Speak Gartok !
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Rugan_03=Thank you, little one!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Hannik_Jakson_01=Let me know once the witch is dead!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Hannik_Jakson_02=Thank you for avenging my brother.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Captain_Sharp_01=I'm busy. come back later.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Captain_Sharp_02=I don't think so!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Captain_Sharp_03=All right!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Sima_Temple_01=Come back later, please.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_City_Sima_Temple_02=I'm busy right now. Sorry!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_1_Bully_NPC=What?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_2_Player_Any=Go away! You're bothering everyone!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_3_Bully_NPC=Get lost!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_4_ChoiceA_Intimidate=You want to die? Well, if you insist…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_5_ChoiceB_Deception=We'll denounce you to Orenetis!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_6_ChoiceC_Persuade=Be reasonable!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_7_ChoiceD_Attack=Attack
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_8_ChoiceA_Player=One against four - do you think you can win?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_9_ChoiceA_Fail=You don't scare me!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_10_ChoiceA_Success=You're lucky I'm a pacifist!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_11_ChoiceB_Player=Do you think the Lord Protector knows how you behave?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_12_ChoiceB_Fail=I don't care!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_13_ChoiceB_Success=No, I…fine, I'll go.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_14_ChoiceC_Player=You're better than this. You're making a fool of yourself here.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_15_ChoiceC_Fail=Doesn't matter!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_03_16_ChoiceC_Success=You're right…my mother, she…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_1_Player_Any=Lieutenant Sharp-Eyes?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_2_Sharpeyes_NPC=That's me.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_3_Player_Any=We suggest you get a posting back home.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_4_Player_Cynical=Anywhere far from here would do, actually.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_5_Sharpeyes_NPC=What? How dare you?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=We have proof you're a thief.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=We know you're a thief.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_8_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=You won't live long if you stay here.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=We should go.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_10_Player_ChoiceA=We have proof that you stole from the Lord Protector!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_11_Player_ChoiceB=We know you stole from the Lord Protector!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_12_Player_ChoiceC=You should be careful. You've made a lot of enemies here.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_13_Player_ChoiceD=Never mind.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_14_Sharpeyes_ChoiceA=What? You…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_15_Sharpeyes_ChoiceA=Fine. I'll ask again. The commander will agree, I think.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_16_Sharpeyes_ChoiceB=Say that again and I'll kill you!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_17_Sharpeyes_ChoiceC=Are you threatening me?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_18_Sharpeyes_ChoiceD=That's right, get lost!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_18_Sharpeyes_Banter=Move along…
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_1_Player_Any=Commander?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_2_Malariel_NPC=What do you want?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_3_Player_Any=To report something.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_4_Player_Any=This was in the hands of Lieutenant Sharp-Eyes.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_5_Player_Any=Clearly, that's not hers.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_6_Malariel_NPC=Lord Flame-Heart's ring?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_7_Malariel_NPC=We will question her.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_8_Player_Any=Lieutenant Sharpeyes stole something from the palace - a jeweled ring.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_9_Malariel_NPC=This is a grave accusation. Do you have proof?
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_10_Player_Any=We saw it. She was trying to hide it.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_11_Malariel_NPC=You'd better not be wrong about this.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_Denounce_12_Malariel_NPC=Move along!
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_EndBanter_01=Commander Brogarad had lieutenant Sharp-Eyes arrested.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_EndBanter_02=Well… we all know what that means.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_04_EndBanter_03=Lieutenant Sharp-Eyes has been posted elsewhere… I think.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_Additional_10_Player_Default=One thing, though.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_Additional_11_Player_Default=The rebels have their own access, from their hidden headquarters.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_08_End_Additional_12_Player_Default=You'll have to share with them.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_18_Player_Authority=Karelia Snowfox, you're under arrest…
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_19_Player_Authority=…in the name of Orenetis, Lord Protector of the Dominion!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_20_Karelia_NPC=What? What for? Speaking too loud?
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_21_Player_Authority=Don't make it difficult. Come with us quietly.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_22_Player_Authority=We have full authority to use force, if necessary.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_23_Karelia_NPC=Well, then - take your best shot, flunkeys!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_end_24_Karelia_NPC=The people won't forget what you did, there.
Narration/&DLC1_Rebellion_05_End_Additional_Player=Just give us something. We have so many questions.
Narration/&DLC1_ThePeople_05_1_Player_Default=Rose sent us.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_A1_Return=You finally leave the valley, and return to the Principality of Masgarth.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_B1_OrenetisRules=Orenetis is firmly seated on his throne, more powerful than ever.

Narration/&DLC1_Ending_B3_AnfarelsRule=A new flag flies over the palace: that of the Anfarels, a family older even that the Manacalon Empire.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_B3_AnfarelsRule2=The citizens of the valley hope for a better ruler than before, but nothing is ever certain.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_B4_NoOneRules=The throne of the valley is empty, chaos is lurking, yet the citizens of the valley hold together as they always did.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_C1_ComplexIsRunning=The hidden research complex where Orenetis used to work on monsters is fully working again, producing more horrors than even before.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_C1_ComplexIsRunning2=…producing more horrors than even before.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_C2_ComplexIsDestroyed=The hidden research complex where Orenetis used to work on monsters monsters is destroyed, no one will be able to repair the damage it's taken.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_C2_ComplexIsDestroyed2=…no one will be able to repair the damage it's taken.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_C3_ComplexIsLocked=The hidden research complex where Orenetis used to work on monsters is locked - but for how long?
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_C4_ComplexIsInForgeHands=The hidden research complex is no longer in the hands of Orenetis, but who knows how it might be used in the future?
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_D1_VingIsKingCeiwad=Marin Ving is now king of the valley, and will soon talk to the Princess Ceiwad as his equal.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_D2_VingIsKingMisaye=Marin Ving is now king of the valley, and the church of Misaye in Masgarth will honor his deeds.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_D3_VingIsKingSecret=Marin Ving is now king of the valley, though beyond its frontiers, no one will never now.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_D4_VingIsNotFound=Marin Ving remains elusive. Maybe he was never there.
Narration/&DLC1_Ending_D5_VingIsDead=Marin Ving is dead. The news might please some of his old enemies in Masgarth, and disappoint his creditors.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Swamp_Witch_01=Hail Agatha, spider queen.
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Swamp_Witch_02=I heard something!
Narration/&Player_Banter_Location_Swamp_Witch_03=I think the door is unlocked.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_report_1_Player_Any=It is done. Snowfox has been sent to the brig.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_report_2_Malariel_NPC=Good. I'll interrogate her myself.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_report_3_Player_NPC=Snowfox resisted. We had no choice but to kill her.
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_report_4_Malariel_NPC=Good riddance!
Narration/&DLC1_Orenetis_06_report_5_Malariel_NPC=The Lord Protector will be pleased.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_ChoiceA=We'll take the gold.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_ChoiceB=We'll take the poison.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_ChoiceC=We'll take the healing potions.
Narration/&DLC1_Marches_CS05_Galar_ChoiceD=We'll take the magic dust.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_MajorGate_Sabotaged=The Major Gate doesn't work. It's missing part of its floor.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_MajorGate_Repaired=Should be good now. Let's try!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_MajorGate_NoMana=We need to find a way to supply the Gate with mana.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_MajorGate_NoPassword=Oh come on! What now, are we missing a password or something?
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_MajorGate_Use=Password!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_ManaGenerator_Control_Sabotaged=It doesn't work. We need to repair the generator.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_ManaGenerator_Gears_RepairPossible=The generator should be fixed. We can activate it now.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Gartok_01=Little one good friends !
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Gartok_02=Hogar was good friend…
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_13=Oh no! Look like Hogar didn't make it. We need to inform Gartok.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_14=What happened in here ?
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_ManaGenerator_Control_Deactivate=The generator won't supply mana any more.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_ManaGenerator_Control_Activate=Let the mana flow!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_ManaGenerator_Gears_Sabotage=The generator won't work now - ha!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_15=I guess this is the famous potion.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_16=Hmm… looks like we need a key to activate this switch.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_17=The switch requires a key to be activated.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_ManaGenerator_Gears_RepairImpossible=One vital part is missing.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_People_08_Freed_01=Oh, thanks! For the People!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_People_08_Freed_02=Thank you! We'll tell to everyone you freed us.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_People_08_Jail_01=Please, help me!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_People_08_Jail_02=Please, help us!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_1_Player_Default=We found what Orenetis was hiding in the jungle.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_2_Hasdrubal_NPC=I'm all ears!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_3_Player_Default=A secret laboratory.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_4_Player_Default=He performs experiments on monsters to make them…worse.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_5_Player_Default=His goals may not be that simple, but still…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_6_Hasdrubal_NPC=I knew it.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_7_Hasdrubal_NPC=I received reports of these…mutants, all around.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_8_Player_Default=We thought you might like to take a look at the facilities.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_9_Hasdrubal_NPC=You were right. There's plenty to learn - and loot - in a place like this.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_10_Player_Default=Well, it's pretty much clear of monsters, so you're free to go.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_11_Hasdrubal_NPC=That's very much appreciated.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_12_Player_Default=It doesn't help us get home, though.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_13_Hasdrubal_NPC=I may have a way, although it's very dangerous.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_14_Player_Default=What's that?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_15_Hasdrubal_NPC=One of my informants in Caer Hyfryd told me about about a secret passage…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_16_Hasdrubal_NPC=…right into Orenetis' palace.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_17_Hasdrubal_NPC=And as for the redeemers, he has a magical device that keeps them at bay.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_18_Hasdrubal_NPC=With that in your possession, you could return to Masgarth.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_19_Player_Default=It's worth a try! Where's the entrance to this passage?
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_09_Return_20_Hasdrubal_NPC=Of course, my friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_13_Telerien_NPC=We made a deal with the giants. They're pretty friendly.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_03_End_14_Telerien_NPC=Don't ask us why, but they're smarter than average. You can even do business with them.
Narration/&DLC1_ForgeHasdrubalGenericRecall_NPC=Thank you, my friends. I will need you help later.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_19=I think I found it.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_20=Nothing interesting here.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_ManaGenerator_GetFragment=We should be able to repair the mana generator with this.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Complex_MajorGate_GetFragment=We should be able to repair the Major Gate with this.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_FindDoor_1_Player_ArcanaHistory=What kind of runes are these? I've never seen anything like them.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_FindDoor_2_Player_Logical=Maybe it's a local thing.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_FindDoor_3_Player_ArcanaHistory=We might find someone in town who knows about it.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_FindDoor_4_Player_ArcanaHistory=Right now, the place is sealed with powerful magic.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_TuznanBanter1_Tuznan_NPC=Hello, strangers!
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_TuznanBanter2_Tuznan_NPC=My name is Tuznan Anfarel, master historian.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_MeetTuznan_1_Player_ArcanaHistory=You said you were a historian, right?
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_MeetTuznan_2_Tuznan_NPC=Indeed. My family is older than the Manacalon empire itself…
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_MeetTuznan_3_Tuznan_NPC=…and my passion is to study that long-lost period of Solastan history.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_MeetTuznan_4_Player_ArcanaHistory=Well, we found a very old, ruined temple in the swamps.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_MeetTuznan_5_Player_ArcanaHistory=With runes that are neither dwarven nor…well anything we can make sense out of.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_MeetTuznan_6_Tuznan_NPC=Oh - that sounds interesting!
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_MeetTuznan_7_Tuznan_NPC=Take me there, and I will enlighten you…for free.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_OpenDoor_1_Tuznan_NPC=Oh, yes, this is it…Dinas Scath!
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_OpenDoor_2_Any_Player=What's that?
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_OpenDoor_3_Tuznan_NPC=An ancient city, disapeared during the Cataclysm.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_OpenDoor_4_Tuznan_NPC=It was here!
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_OpenDoor_5_Tuznan_NPC=My ancestors ruled it.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_OpenDoor_6_Tuznan_NPC=Zheha Deni Kelo!
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_OpenDoor_7_Any_Player=Well done!
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_1_Tuznan_NPC=The place is charged with negative energy.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_2_Tuznan_NPC=It needs cleansing.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_3_Player_Any=Need a hand?
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_4_Tuznan_NPC=No, this requires my specialist knowledge.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_5_Tuznan_NPC=I will perform the ritual.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_6_Tuznan_NPC=Yes…the spirits of the ancient kings are still here.
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_7_Tuznan_NPC=The Anfarels will rise again!
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_8_Player_Any=Wait…is that really a cleansing ritual?
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_9_Tuznan_NPC=All those who stain the domain of the king shall sink in the waters of despair!
Narration/&DLC1_DinasScath_Ritual_10_Tuznan_NPC=All of them!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Forge_01=Go talk to Telerien, please. I'm busy.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Valley_Forge_02=You can rest here if you want.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Hanno_01=The rebellion has given you a rendezvous point not too far to the north. Be safe !
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Swamp_Hanno_02=I've taken the liberty of marking the rendezvous point on your map.
Narration/&New_Player_Banters75_TeleportOrFly=I think it's possible to fly over this.
Narration/&New_Player_Banters76_TeleportOrFly=Or maybe teleport through it.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Location_Complex_21=Something's blocking the door - it won't move!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Pray_Misaye=Lady of Luck, please smile on us!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Pray_Pakri=Helps us find the answers, Wise Owl.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Pray_Maraike=There's life yet, Sweet Mother.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Pray_Arun=May your fire warm our hearts, All-father.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Pray_Einar=Give fire to our blades, Father Knight.
Narration/&New_Player_Banters77_Suspicious=Hard to guess what that means exactly.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_MysteriousPalace_Outside_AccessLocked=We can't get in any more. I guess this place is closed forever.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_MysteriousPalace_BattleRoom_SpaceShifted=Wow, this room wasn't there before. How do we get outside now?
Narration/&NPC_Banter_MysteriousPalace_Library_FindingCorpse=I guess we founded our men. What an awful death.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Generic_Outpost_Male_Warning1=Stay away! This area is forbidden - even for you.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Generic_Outpost_Male_Warning2=If you step inside, you're dead!
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Generic_Outpost_Female_Warning1=Stay away! This area is forbidden - even for you.
Narration/&NPC_Banter_Generic_Outpost_Female_Warning2=If you step inside, you're dead!
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_1_Hanno_NPC=Hey, friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_2_Hanno_NPC=I know you're trustworthy and…strong…
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_3_Hanno_NPC=…I need help.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_4_Hanno_NPC=A bunch of our scouts didn't come back from a mission.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_5_Hanno_NPC=My cousin is one of them.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_6_Hanno_NPC=Hasdrubal wants to give them more time but…
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_7_Hanno_NPC=…if you could just go take a look?
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_8_Player_Any=Sure, we'll do that.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_9_Hanno_NPC=Thank you, friends!
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_10_Hanno_NPC=It's another ruin from Imperial times, maybe earlier.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_11_Hanno_NPC=We expected to find some decent loot there. My cousin put the team together.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_12_Hanno_NPC=It's been a week now.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_13_Hanno_NPC=I'll mark the location on your map.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Intro_14_Hanno_NPC=See you soon. Be careful out there!
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Weird_1_Player_Any=Look, an underground lake - or river.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Weird_2_Player_Any=What are you talking about? This is a library!
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Weird_3_Player_Any=What?
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Weird_4_Player_Any=In the Badlands…
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Weird_5_Player_Any=…we get it. Thank you.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Weird_6_Player_Any=So where do we go?
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Weird_7_Player_Any=Books or…fish?
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_1_Hanno_NPC=Ah, you're back!
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_2_Hanno_NPC=From those faces, I'm not sure it's good news.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_3_Player_Any=Sorry to say, we found them…dead.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_4_Hanno_NPC=Oh…
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_5_Player_Any=The place was rotten with Badlands magic. It's impossible to get back inside.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_6_Hanno_NPC=My sister won't like this.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_7_Hanno_NPC=Anyway, thanks for everything you've done.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_8_Player_Any=You're welcome, Hanno.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_9_Player_Any=Sorry - we didn't find them.
Narration/&DLC1_Mysterious_Ending_10_Hanno_NPC=I'll tell Hasdrubal. He may want to check the place himself.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Locked_3_Player_Default=A simple spell cannot open such a powerful ward.
Narration/&DLC1_WitchPalace_Locked_4_Player_Default=Maybe we'll find a clue somewhere else in the swamp.
Narration/&DLC1_Meeting_1b_Hanno_NPC=I'm the shopkeeper. If you need anything, come to me.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_20_alternate_Klarn_NPC=He has a scepter that will keep redeemers at bay.
Narration/&DLC1_Mask_11_End_21_alternate_Klarn_NPC=I'm pretty sure it's around here, maybe in this very room.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_Swamp_banter_Forge_Guard_NPC=Yes, but I am sure Hasdrubal has a plan.
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_Swamp_banter_Forge_Guard_AfterDeath_DryadQueen_NPC=Yes, I slept under that tree on my last day off, nothing untowards happened…
Narration/&DLC1_Forge_Swamp_banter_Forge_Guard_AfterOrc_Fort_Dealt_withNPC=Yes, I like it when his plans come together!
Narration/&DLC1_Caer_Hyfryd_Palace_banter_Dominion_Soldier_After_Head_Delivery_NPC=Our Lord's research interests are all-encompassing.
Narration/&DLC1_Caer_Hyfryd_Palace_banter_Dominion_Arcanist_After_Rebelbasemissiongiven _NPC=Yes, and soon we will turn it into rubble!
Narration/&DLC1_Caer_Hyfryd_Palace_banter_Dominion_Soldier_After_Rebelbasemissiongiven _NPC=The base of the rebel rabble?

Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Observable_Statue_SorrTarr=This loathsome statue mocks the god Einar, corrupted to portray the foul dark lord Sorr-Tarr. Despite its roughly hewn nature, the stone oozes depravity and wanton malice, its feet coated in dried blood.

Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Observable_Mausoleum=This beautiful building has a plaque written in ancient Manacalon script. It must be some kind of mausoleum. What secrets does it contain? Who were the people that now lie at rest in its dark depths?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlements_Observable_SylvanElves_Architecture=Shaped from living wood with exquisite skill and craftsmanship, the construction of the cabins in this elven settlement is testament to the sylvan elves' ability to adapt to their surroundings.

Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting8_Violet_NPC=Oh no, especially if you're here to talk about Manacalon wizards.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting9_Violet_NPC=Oh, they're dragons, right? You're the ones who found out! That explains so many things!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting10_Player_Nosy=Indeed.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting11_Violet_NPC=Dear Maraike, to think that you've met with some of them. The Magister… amazing!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting12_Player_Authority=Well, we're here about this sigil.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting13_Violet_NPC=Of course! that's Exonaïka the Traveler, Telema's lead teacher!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting14_Violet_NPC=Gods, she was a dragon, too! That's insane!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting15_Player_Authority=So, Exonaïka was a Manacalon wizard?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting16_Violet_NPC=Yes - I must admit, one of my favorites. I read a lot of her writings.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting17_Player_NotHistory=You said something about Telema?

Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting22_Player_Lawful=Do you think Exonaïka had anything to do with creatures called demons?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting23_Violet_NPC=I came across that word in her writings… some kind of monsters?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting24_Violet_NPC=She went to so many places!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting25_Violet_NPC=You know what? I think she's the one who created the Major Gates.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting26_Player_Cynical=Incredible…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting27_Violet_NPC=It is, right?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting28_Violet_NPC=So, maybe she traveled to places we have no idea about, and met with these demons.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting29_Player_Authority=Where did you find these books again?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting30_Violet_NPC=Telema. You could go there and try to find more.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting31_Violet_NPC=One of my friends is still there, Rhuad. He had a crush on this girl - I think he married her.

Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting33_Violet_NPC=Sure! I'll mark it on your map.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting34_Violet_NPC=It's in the middle of the Badlands, though. No Major Gate.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting35_Player_Nosy=About that - how come you have one?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting36_Violet_NPC=Well, I bought this place because of it.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting37_Violet_NPC=It wasn't working, of course. That would have cost me a fortune.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting38_Violet_NPC=But I was able to fix it. Though I still don't fully understand how it works.

Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting44_Violet_NPC=A scavenger had returned from the Badlands, almost dead.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Meeting45_Violet_NPC=So we came to the rescue… didn't work out so well.

Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return2_Violet_NPC=So, how was the trip?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return3_Player_Authority=Unbelievable! You're going to love what we found there.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return4_Violet_NPC=Oh! Well, don't keep me in suspense!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return5_Player_Academic=Exonaïka definitely traveled to other places, other worlds even.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return6_Violet_NPC=Dear Maraike! Did you find any writing?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return7_Player_Academic=Of course, it's here, all in draconic, encrypted…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return8_Player_Authority=Oh, by the way, we found Hector.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return9_Violet_NPC=Gods, I almost had forgotten. So what about my theory?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return10_Player_Authority=He was a Sorak, for sure.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return11_Violet_NPC=Ha! Rhuad owes me a hundred gold pieces.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return12_Player_Academic=He had a bunch of notes on him, also in code.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return13_Player_Academic=They list Sorak infiltration plans throughout the whole of the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return14_Violet_NPC=Really? We must tell the authorities - some of them might still be active!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return15_Violet_NPC=Highrock? I know that place. It's an outpost in the Marches - my friend Garrad runs it.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return16_Violet_NPC=He might be in danger!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return17_Violet_NPC=I have to go!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return18_Player_Authority=Wait, can you decipher Exonaïka's books?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return19_Violet_NPC=Yes, given time. But my friend…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return20_Player_Authority=We'll take care of that, if you'll stay and transcript the books for us.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return21_Violet_NPC=Fine. Highrock's not too far. Tell Garrad I sent you - and find that Sorak infiltrator.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Return22_Player_Authority=You got it!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_InHell1_Player_Selfpres=What is this place?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_InHell2_Player_Authority=We'll have to postpone that debate, I'm afraid.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_AfterHell1_Player_Selpres=These creatures… they're demons!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_AfterHell2_Player_Scholar=Did we travel to their world?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_AfterHell3_Player_Authority=Violet said Exonaïka was a great traveler… but other worlds?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_AfterHell4_Player_Selfpres=She was clearly dealing in dangerous experiments.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_AfterHell5_Player_Scholar=This proves she was linked to demons - we're making progress!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_AfterHell6_Player_Authority=Let's search everywhere. We need to find more!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_KilledDragon1_Player_Authority=Do you think that was her? Exonaïka?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_KilledDragon2_Player_Scholar=Certainly… the Cataclysm killed her, but somehow…

Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting2_Garrad_NPC=It's me. I recognize you, but what are you doing here?
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting3_Player_Friendly=Violet Goodcheer sent us.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting4_Garrad_NPC=Ah, what is it now? Does she need a hand destroying something?
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting5_Player_Cynical=Sounds like she has quite a reputation.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting6_Garrad_NPC=You know, shock arcanists…
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting7_Player_Authority=We're here because we found the remains of Hector, in Telema.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting8_Garrad_NPC=You did?
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting9_Player_Authority=And he was a Sorak.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting10_Garrad_NPC=No surprise there.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting11_Player_Authority=We found documents about his plans, including an operation in this very castle.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting12_Garrad_NPC=Soraks? On my watch? Impossible.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting13_Player_Friendly=They're very good at making people think that.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting14_Garrad_NPC=You're the experts. What do you propose?
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting15_Player_Authority=If you'll allow us, we'll conduct an investigation.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting16_Garrad_NPC=Fine. But don't forget, these people are fighting for the Principality.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_Meeting17_Garrad_NPC=So don't go throwing accusations around lightly.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End1_Player_Authority=Sorry about the mess!
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End2_Garrad_NPC=You were right! I never would have guessed.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End3_Garrad_NPC=Ugly bastard…
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End4_Player_Authority=They shouldn't come back now. They're too busy with Gallivan.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End5_Garrad_NPC=So it's true?
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End6_Player_Authority=They have a grip on Gallivan's royal family, somehow. There's no other explanation.
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End7_Garrad_NPC=Well, let's hope we win this war!
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End8_Player_Authority=We need to go - more Soraks to find!
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End9_Garrad_NPC=Be on your way, then, and say hello to Violet if you see her!
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End10_Player_Authority=We will!
Narration/&DLC3_GarradsCastle_End11_Player_Authority=Stay in the light, Garrad!

Narration/&DLC3_Telema_ReturnToRhuad5_Lena_NPC=Oh, no!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_ReturnToRhuad6_Lena_NPC=I can't believe it!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_ReturnToRhuad7_Player_Friendly=At least now you can mourn.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_ReturnToRhuad8_Lena_NPC=How is it possible? For years, he was like a father to me…
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_ReturnToRhuad9_Player_Authority=…he was managing multiple operations all over the Marches!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_ReturnToRhuad10_Rhuad_NPC=I'll copy this and spread the word!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_ReturnToRhuad11_Player_Authority=Good idea!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_ReturnToRhuad12_Player_Authority=We need to continue our research here.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_ReturnToRhuad14_Lena_NPC=Thank you for finding him!

Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis3_Player_Friendly=Don't mention it!
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis4_Vigdis_NPC=Have you ever seen such creatures?
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis5_Player_Scholar=Those flying ones? They weren't Soraks for sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis6_Player_Selfpres=No, but they're described in some of my people's legends… they're called demons.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis7_Player_Scholar=Demons, you say? Well, they seemed to be backing up the Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis8_Player_Selfpres=That can't be a coincidence.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis9_Vigdis_NPC=But why us?
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis10_Player_Selfpres=You mean you. First your father, then you.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis11_Player_Selfpres=Someone has a grudge against your family.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis12_Player_Scholar=Soraks and demons? That's not the same as a jealous neighbor.

Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis21_Vigdis_NPC=We're wealthy, but less so than the Keskainen clan, for instance.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis22_Vigdis_NPC=I don't see how killing me would make anyone else richer.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis23_Vigdis_NPC=The Snow Alliance is a democratic system.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis24_Vigdis_NPC=Each clan has votes based on its numbers.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis25_Vigdis_NPC=So no, we're not particularly influential.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis26_Vigdis_NPC=Not that I know of, no.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis27_Vigdis_NPC=Business is pretty good, from what my father told me.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis28_Vigdis_NPC=What is that supposed to mean?
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis29_Player_D_Nosy=Oh, you know - a centuries-long betrayal, kidnapped children, anything like that?
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis30_Vigdis_NPC=You're ridiculous. We don't have any dark secrets.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis31_Vigdis_NPC=…and yet…
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis32_Vigdis_NPC=…there's the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis33_Vigdis_NPC=Between five clans, from before the Snow Alliance was founded.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis34_Vigdis_NPC=But it's just a tradition. It has no political weight.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis46_Player_Authority=Don't brush this off so quickly.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis47_Player_Authority=There may be something there.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis48_Vigdis_NPC=I'm sorry I can't say any more right now.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis49_Vigdis_NPC=When we get home, I might be able to tell you more.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis50_Vigdis_NPC=I will have to get my father's amulet, anyway.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis52_Vigdis_NPC=Fine. Now, I'd really like to get some sleep.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad1_Violet_NPC=How did it go?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad2_Player_Authority=You were right, one of Garrad's troopers was a Sorak infiltrator.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad3_Violet_NPC=Sweet mother Maraike! You killed it?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad4_Player_Authority=We did. Garrad sends his regards.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad5_Violet_NPC=That's good. Now - I've made some progress on Exonaïka's notes.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad6_Player_Authority=You haven't finished?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad7_Violet_NPC=You didn't exactly leave me a lot of time…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad8_Violet_NPC=…though I'm glad for Garrad, of course.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad9_Violet_NPC=It's very fragmentary, and there are a lot of references to…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad10_Violet_NPC=…older times, but I have some clues.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad11_Violet_NPC=There is a passage, somewhere up north…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad12_Violet_NPC=…a Gate to the Demon Realms.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad13_Violet_NPC=There's a fortress, or prison…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad14_Violet_NPC=…guarded by someone, through a pact with Exonaïka.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad15_Violet_NPC=I don't think it's the Snow Alliance, it's something else.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad16_Player_Scholar=What about the Pact of the Claw?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad17_Violet_NPC=Uh, where did you hear that name?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad18_Player_Friendly=Vigdis told us about it. An old tradition.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad19_Violet_NPC=It does… yes, that word could mean claw, in a way, I guess.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad20_Violet_NPC=Well, if that's it, this pact has a representative of sorts…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad21_Violet_NPC=…a Speaker.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad22_Player_Friendly=Which means this old pact is much more important than Vigdis thought.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad23_Player_Scholar=More than everyone thought. Who was that elder Vigdis talked about?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad24_Violet_NPC=You must be speaking about Gorm the Wise.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad25_Player_Scholar=Yes, that's it. Vigdis said she could have sent us to him, too.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad26_Violet_NPC=Great! You can go to White Rock City through my Gate, Gorm has one, too.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad27_Player_Scholar=And I thought those were rare…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad28_Violet_NPC=Well, not anymore. Anyway, I need to clarify some more points, here…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad29_Violet_NPC=…as soon I have more…
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad30_Violet_NPC=…I'll jump through my Gate to bring you the news.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad31_Player_Friendly=Understood.
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad32_Player_Friendly=Thanks for your help, Violet!
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_AfterGarrad33_Player_Authority=Let's go meet this Gorm.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter1_Vigdis_NPC=Clear skies!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter2_Player_Any=Lady Vigdis?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter3_Vigdis_NPC=It's me. I hear you're coming with us to Kaupaapunki?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter4_Vigdis_NPC=Tell me when you're ready. I'll be waiting near the road.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard1_Player_Authority=We need to see your Elder.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard2_ElderGuardCaptainFemale_NPC=(In elvish) - He cannot receive anyone today.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard3_Player_Formal=What is this gibberish?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard2_ElderGuardCaptainFemale_NPC_elvish=El nare vo til alsea.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard4_Player_Normal=What was that?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard5_Player_SpeakElvish=She pretends not to speak the common tongue.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard6_Player_NonElvish=Come on! This is important!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard7_ElderGuardCaptainFemale_NPC=(In common) - The Elder will see you tomorrow.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard8_Player_NonElvish=This is preposterous!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard9_Player_NonElvish=That's ridiculous!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard10_Player_SpeakElvish=Friend, this cannot wait! Your clan is in danger!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard11_ElderGuardCaptainFemale_NPC=Alright. The Elder will see you.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard12_NOAUDIO_NPC=Convince in Elvish
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Guard13_NOAUDIO_NPC=Complain
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder1_Player_Friendly=Master Sharpmind, you're a busy person!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder2_Elder_NPC=What brings you here in such a hurry, strangers?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder3_Player_Authority=The Pact of the Claw - do you remember?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder4_Elder_NPC=What about it?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder5_Player_Scholar=You and the others must meet to elect a new Speaker.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder6_Elder_NPC=I don't have time for this!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder7_Player_Authority=The Pact is more crucial than you think.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder8_Elder_NPC=Don't lecture me, youngling!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder9_Elder_NPC=I have survived the Cataclysm, the collapse of mana!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder10_Elder_NPC=I fought the War of Sorrow, so don't tell me what is crucial!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder11_Player_Friendly=Sorry!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder12_Player_Authority=No need to be rude.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder13_Elder_NPC=My people are disappearing, down in the forest.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder14_Elder_NPC=Something is taking them.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder15_Elder_NPC=If you want my help, you must prove yourselves.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder16_Elder_NPC=Find what is happening to the foragers. This cannot go on.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder17_Elder_NPC=The mushrooms and roots that grow under the canopy are vital to us.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder18_Player_Violent=Monster hunting, eh?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder19_Player_Authority=Fine! We'll secure the area in no time!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MeetElder20_Elder_NPC=We'll see.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn1_Player_Authority=It's done! The area is cleared.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn2_Elder_NPC=Really?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn3_Player_Violent=A few pests, and a couple of dragons nesting in a nearby cave.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn4_Elder_NPC=Horrid creatures, degenerate offspring of the Cataclysm.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn5_Player_Authority=They're still pretty tough.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn6_Elder_NPC=But you got rid of them?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn7_Player_Violent=We've seen worse.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn8_Elder_NPC=Ah, true heroes you are!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn9_Elder_NPC=Alas, I need your help again.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn10_Player_Cynical=Why am I not surprised?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn11_Elder_NPC=I would gladly go to meet the other clan chiefs and move for a vote…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn12_Elder_NPC=…but I can't leave the settlements right now.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn13_Player_Authority=Why not?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn14_Elder_NPC=Some young elves are stirring up trouble with dreams of racial supremacy.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn15_Player_Authority=What?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn16_Elder_NPC=Fools - and some of them worse.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn17_Elder_NPC=They believe the Manacalon way should be restored.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn18_Player_Cynical=Send them to the New Empire, then.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn19_Elder_NPC=This is no laughing matter.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn20_Elder_NPC=The slavery, the hate, the cleansing… they don't even believe it.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn21_Player_Cynical=Who taught them this?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn22_Elder_NPC=That is a good question. Some foul influence is at work.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn23_Player_Violent=Soraks?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn24_Elder_NPC=Maybe. Everyone is on their toes since the war.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn25_Elder_NPC=Anyway, I need you to bring me something back.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn26_Elder_NPC=Nearby is the ruin of an elven residence, and a mausoleum built for an elf woman.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn27_Elder_NPC=Bring me back her ring.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn28_Player_Lawful=You want us to rob a tomb?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn29_Elder_NPC=She would approve if it can stop this Manacalon folly.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn31_Player_Authority=Not really. If you agree to forbid foraging during the day, there will be no more… hunting.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn32_Elder_NPC=You made a deal with dragons?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn33_Player_Lawful=So you knew there were dragons?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn34_Elder_NPC=I suspected so.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturn35_Player_Authority=Anyway, you did well. My people will only forage during the night.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain1_Elder_NPC=My friends, did you succeed? Do you have it?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain3_Elder_NPC=Good! Good!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain4_Player_Nosy=How is this going to help you stop Manacalon fanatics?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain5_Elder_NPC=It will provide me with enough inspiration to share my feelings through music.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain6_Elder_NPC=I have been a bard for more than a millennium.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain7_Elder_NPC=I was the only son of a wealthy Manacalon family.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain8_Elder_NPC=When I fell in love with a slave and settled not far from here to live with her…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain9_Elder_NPC=…I thought I had freed myself from the tyranny of the Empire.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain10_Elder_NPC=But a band of fanatics tracked us down and took her.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain11_Elder_NPC=I found her body mutilated and burned.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain12_Player_Friendly=Monsters.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain13_Elder_NPC=I was broken, overwhelmed with grief and anger.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain14_Elder_NPC=When the Snow Alliance was formed, I became one of its leaders.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain15_Elder_NPC=I fought the Manacalon Empire until the day that the Rift finished the job.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain16_Elder_NPC=And now it's happening again.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain17_Elder_NPC=I never told these young elves what I just told you.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain18_Elder_NPC=I will sing my story to them, convince them to see the truth.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain19_Player_Friendly=Let's hope so. It would be a shame to have suffered so much for nothing.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain20_Elder_NPC=By all the gods, I can still see her face!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain21_Elder_NPC=I'm sorry, this brings back so many emotions.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain22_Elder_NPC=Would you mind giving me a few hours to… pull myself together?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain24_Player_Authority=We'll come back later.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgain25_Elder_NPC=Thank you.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgainb2_Player_Friendly=We do, and we met your wife's ghost.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgainb3_Elder_NPC=What?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgainb4_Player_Friendly=Her soul could not rest while the Empire still ruled.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgainb5_Player_Friendly=But when she learned what you had done, she joined Maraike.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderReturnAgainb6_Elder_NPC=This brings back so many memories.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost1_LeralynsGhost_NPC=Stay away!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost2_Player_Friendly=Wait! We're not here to rob you!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost3_LeralynsGhost_NPC=Oh? Why are you here, then? To pay your respects?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost4_Player_Friendly=Estorgath Sharpmind sent us.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost5_LeralynsGhost_NPC=Don't you dare say his name!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost6_Player_Friendly=It's true! He said you'd help us fight some Manacalon fanatics.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost7_LeralynsGhost_NPC=My husband is alive?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost8_Player_Friendly=Oh, yes! He is… quite old, but yes.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost9_Player_Friendly=He's a very respected chief. He led the fight against the Empire.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost10_LeralynsGhost_NPC=And now sylvan elves and high elves live together in peace.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost11_LeralynsGhost_NPC=He made it… our dream came true!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost12_LeralynsGhost_NPC=My rage is fading…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost13_LeralynsGhost_NPC=…I feel my purpose slipping away…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost14_LeralynsGhost_NPC=…tell him… I'm proud, and at peace…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost15_LeralynsGhost_NPC=…take this ring to him…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_LeralynsGhost16_Player_Friendly=Wait…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego1_Dragonborn_NPC=Hold it!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego2_Player_Authority=Who are you?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego3_Dragonborn_NPC=My name does not matter. You are not welcome here.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego4_NOAUDIO_Authority=Do you have something to do with the disappearances?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego5_NOAUDIO_Draconic=(Draconic) Please, we just want to talk.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego6_NOAUDIO_Violence=Explain yourself or die.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego7_NOAUDIO_Friendly=Speak or we let the elves kill you.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego8_Player_Friendly=Fine. The elves will attack soon, anyway.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego9_Player_Violence=We're not leaving without an answer.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego10_Dragonborn_NPC=You're making a huge mistake.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego11_Player_Authority=People have gone missing around here.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego12_Player_Authority=And now, you want us to go away?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego13_Dragonborn_NPC=I have nothing to tell you.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego14_Player_Draconic=Come on! We just want to ask you a few questions.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego15_Dragonborn_NPC=It's never just questions.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego16_Player_Draconic=Do you know what happened to the settlers who disappeared?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego17_Dragonborn_NPC=The area is full of monsters.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego18_Player_Friendly=Including you?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego19_Dragonborn_NPC=I'm protecting friends. A mother and her child.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego20_Player_Draconic=Your friends are killing the locals?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego21_Dragonborn_NPC=A mother needs to eat.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego22_Player_Draconic=This can't end well. The elves are numerous, they'll come in force.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego23_Player_Draconic=Your friends should go, to avoid bloodshed.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego24_Dragonborn_NPC=Alright. We'll find somewhere else.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego25_Player_Draconic=It's the right thing to do.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego26_Dragonborn_NPC=Let them come. This is our home!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego27_Player_Draconic=This is a mistake.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego28_Dragonborn_NPC=You're the ones making a mistake.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego29_Dragonborn_NPC=The elves live in the canopy. Why should they need to come down here where we hunt?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego30_Player_Draconic=They need mushrooms and roots, that's all.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego31_Player_Draconic=Wait - when do your… friends do their hunting?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego32_Dragonborn_NPC=At dawn. It's the best time to find winter wolves.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego33_Player_Draconic=How about you take the day, and the elves take the night?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego34_Dragonborn_NPC=I suppose it's possible.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego35_Player_Draconic=It's a deal! We'll tell the elves to stay away during the day.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DragonNego36_Dragonborn_NPC=I hope this works. Thank you for your efforts.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter5_Beric_NPC=We moved your belongings to the guest room.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter6_Beric_NPC=I trust you.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter7_Beric_NPC=Lady Vigdis is waiting for you in the gardens.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter8_Player_Friendly=I miss that Crown. Its power was reassuring!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter9_Player_Cynical=Well, it's just an old relic now, without the gems.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter10_Player_Lawful=Still, it's a reminder of our old journey from deputies to peers of the Principality.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter11_Player_Cynical=You do look older, for sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter12_Beric_NPC=The market is outside.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter13_Player_Any=Thank you, Marshal.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor1_Player_Authority=Where's Master Sharpmind?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor2_Advisor_NPC=No one knows, that's the problem.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor3_Player_Authority=He said he would convince the separatists.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor4_Advisor_NPC=Well, he went around the settlements, sang his tales of the War of Sorrows.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor5_Advisor_NPC=He told Leralyn's story to all…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor6_Advisor_NPC=…but then, no trace of him.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor7_Advisor_NPC=Yet I have a lead.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor8_Advisor_NPC=He took a key to his old mansion.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor9_Player_Authority=Near his wife's tomb? We saw it.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor10_Advisor_NPC=If it's acceptable to you, I'd like you to escort me there.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToTraitor11_Advisor_NPC=I have a spare key.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_AfterBetrayal1_Player_Selfpres=I knew it!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_AfterBetrayal2_Player_Mean=Really? So why didn't you say so?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_AfterBetrayal3_Player_Lawful=I'm more worried about the fact that Soraks are teaming up with demons.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_AfterBetrayal4_Player_Friendly=Anyway, that doesn't tell us what happened to Sharpmind.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_AfterBetrayal5_Player_Selfpres=We need to go back. This may have just been a diversion.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder1_Player_Friendly=Master Sharpmind, are you alright?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder2_Elder_NPC=Thanks to you, these Sorr-Akkath are as… monstrous as I was told.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder3_Player_Authority=Where were you?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder4_Elder_NPC=Just resting. I heard that Dyssalim took you to my old house?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder5_Player_Authority=Dyssalim… he was an incubus.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder6_Elder_NPC=No! A demon?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder7_Player_Friendly=The elf you knew might still be alive, somewhere around.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder8_Elder_NPC=Let's hope so. Anyway, our troubles here are far from over.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder9_Player_Lawful=You really need to take care of the Pact. It needs a Speaker!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder10_Player_Lawful=The demon proves there is no time to lose!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder11_Elder_NPC=I'm sorry - the clan comes first!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder12_Player_Friendly=Did your bardic inspiration not convince your people?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder13_Elder_NPC=Let's say it helped separate the wheat from the chaff.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder14_Elder_NPC=There clearly is a group of elves whom I cannot convince.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder15_Elder_NPC=Greybear's hunters - they gather at Pine Grove and weave plots for elven supremacy.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder16_Elder_NPC=I fear they'll take over if I leave for Valkarokkopun.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder17_NOAUDIO_A=We're not murderers!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder18_NOAUDIO_B=Manacalon fanatics must die!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder19_NOAUDIO_C=We'll deal with them in exchange for your vote.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder20_Player_LawfulGood=Are you asking us to kill these elves?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder21_Elder_NPC=This battle is coming whether you want it or not.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder22_Player_Violent=Manacalon fanatics? We'll kill them with pleasure!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder23_Elder_NPC=There is no pleasure for me here, just necessity.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder24_Player_Pragmatic=We'll do your dirty work if you vote for our candidate for Speaker.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder25_Elder_NPC=You're more ruthless than I thought. Fine, we have an agreement.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder_Banter29_Player_Nosy=What happened to the gentle old elf?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_FakeElder_Banter30_Player_Pragmatic=Let's speak to this Greybear before we do anything rash.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear1_Player_Authority=Are you Greybear?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear2_Greybear_NPC=That's me.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear3_Player_Authority=We hear you're not getting along very well with your elder.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear4_Greybear_NPC=And who told you that? Him?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear5_Greybear_NPC=Something's off. You heard about Sorak infiltrators?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear6_Player_Authority=What do you think?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear7_Greybear_NPC=Of course you have! You fought them!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear8_Greybear_NPC=If you have a trick to unmask them, I suggest you check on Sharpmind.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear9_Player_Authority=You think he's a Sorak?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear10_Greybear_NPC=One of my hunters saw… something… while you were in those ruins.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear11_Greybear_NPC=I have a key that opens a backdoor to the Manacalon house, near the bridge.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear12_Player_Authority=Sounds like a trap.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear13_Greybear_NPC=Sharpmind was seen coming out of that house.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear14_Greybear_NPC=He never goes down there - not sylvan enough for him!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SpeakToGreybear15_Greybear_NPC=Or you can do whatever you came here to do.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SavedElder2_Elder_NPC=I am now!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SavedElder3_Elder_NPC=The threat is greater than I thought!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SavedElder4_Player_Authority=We told you! Demons are working with the Soraks!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SavedElder5_Player_Authority=The Pact of the Claw must be restored!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SavedElder6_Elder_NPC=Fine. I will come to Valkarokkopun when called upon, you have my word.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SavedElder7_Player_Authority=That's all we need!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_SavedElder11_Elder_NPC=Thanks you for what you did.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_KilledSylvans1_Player_Authority=It is - no more Manacalon lovers around here.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_KilledSylvans2_Elder_NPC=Excellent!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_KilledSylvans3_Elder_NPC=Peace is now restored.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_KilledSylvans4_Player_Authority=So, can we finally talk about why we came here?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter14_Player_Any=Alright, enough reminiscing!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter15_Player_Friendly=Alright, gather your stuff.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter16_Player_Cynical=I'm not sure this is mine.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter17_Player_Lawful=Hey, nobody touches my underwear.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter18_Player_Cynical=No chance of that…
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingTheGate1_Player_Selfpres=Look at that…
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingTheGate2_Player_Pragmatic=You think this is a Gate to the Demon Realms?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingTheGate3_Player_Selfpres=I don't think I want to find out!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingTheGate4_Player_Nosy=I thought killing Sessroth would… I don't know, maybe close this?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingTheGate5_Player_Authority=The Palace goes beyond this room. Let's look around for a clue.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingThePillar1_Player_Nosy=How interesting.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingThePillar2_Player_Nosy=Those pillars… they're linked to the Palace itself.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingThePillar3_Player_Slang=I feel like smashing it - don't know why.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingThePillar4_Player_Formal=I say we destroy this structure and see what happens.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SeeingThePillar5_Player_Selfpres=I'm pretty sure it won't be simple.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals1_King_NPC=Thank you, whoever you are!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals2_Queen_NPC=Thank you, whoever you are!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals3_Heir_NPC=Thank you, whoever you are!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals4_Cousin_NPC=Thank you, whoever you are!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals5_Player_History=Are you… King Jornalas IV of Gallivan?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals6_Player_History=Are you… the Queen of Gallivan?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals7_Player_History=Why does your face seem familiar?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals8_King_NPC=Yes! And you?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals9_Queen_NPC=Yes! And you?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals10_Heir_NPC=I'm King Jornalas' son! And you - who are you?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals11_Cousin_NPC=I'm King Jornalas' cousin! And you - who are you?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals12_Player_Authority=It's a long story, but we're here to help!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals13_King_NPC=The Soraks… they're real!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals14_Queen_NPC=Soraks… they're real!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals15_Heir_NPC=The Soraks… they're real!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals16_Cousin_NPC=Soraks… they're real!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals17_Player_Selfpres=By the gods, you've really been gone for a long time!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals18_Player_Authority=You need to stay here - it's not safe outside!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals19_Player_Authority=Hide, and stay safe!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals20_King_NPC=Understood!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals21_Queen_NPC=Understood!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals22_Heir_NPC=Understood!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals23_Cousin_NPC=Understood!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals24_Player_Cynical=I love the way you just casually bark orders to royalty!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_SavedTheRoyals25_Player_Authority=Not now…
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth1_Sessroth_NPC=Muhahaha!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth2_Player_Cynical=Bravo - a perfect cliché.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth3_Sessroth_NPC=Is that so? Don't you realize how ridiculous you are?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth4_Sessroth_NPC=Walking right into my palace - it's like you're begging me to take your lives!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth5_Player_Paladin=Cut the small talk and fight, you filthy beast!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_1_Player_Authority=General Blunt?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_2_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Not now!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_3_Player_Authority=This is important. It's about the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_4_GeneralBlunt_NPC=I know who you are. Lord Rivers sent me a message telling me to expect your visit.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_5_GeneralBlunt_NPC=We're in the middle of a war, you know - a war you may well have triggered!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_6_Player_Lawful=That's unfair. Gallivan was rotten long before we did anything.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_7_CaptainAshdown_NPC=General, we don't have time! Gallivan's troopers are in sight!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_8_GeneralBlunt_NPC=See? Lend us a hand or you'll be talking to our corpses!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_9_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Captain Ashdown, will you please show our guests the way?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_10_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Yes, General!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_1_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Well done out there. You lived up to your reputation.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_2_Player_Friendly=Don't mention it, Captain.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_3_Player_Authority=You're certainly under a lot of pressure here.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_4_CaptainAshdown_NPC=We keep telling that to the parliament.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_5_CaptainAshdown_NPC=The truth is something's off.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_6_CaptainAshdown_NPC=This is not the first time that the enemy attacked at the perfect time and place.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_7_Player_Selfpres=And you suspect an inside job?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_8_CaptainAshdown_NPC=It's more than a suspicion.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_9_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Someone here is leaking information.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_10_Player_Authority=We could investigate.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_11_Player_Authority=We've… developed a certain expertise in finding traitors.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterDefense_12_CaptainAshdown_NPC=That would be a great help.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_1_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Thank you, my friends. I'm not sure we could have repelled Gallivan's troops without your help.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_2_Player_Authority=You know we're not here to fight a war.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_3_GeneralBlunt_NPC=I know, the Pact of the Claw…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_4_GeneralBlunt_NPC=…I intend to honor the word of my ancestors…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_5_GeneralBlunt_NPC=…but we're facing a more immediate danger.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_6_GeneralBlunt_NPC=The other clans make no effort at all to support us, except the Keskainen Vartmerkint.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_6b_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Valdi Boldhand, at least, is a faithful friend of the Alliance.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_7_GeneralBlunt_NPC=So tell me, what's in the Pact for me apart from a of loss of time on the road?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_8_Player_Authority=That's the whole point! There is a great threat looming if the Pact is not renewed.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_9_Player_Authority=Demons.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_10_GeneralBlunt_NPC=What? I already have my hands full!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_11_GeneralBlunt_NPC=We have fanatical enemies, Sorak assassins - even giants - all attacking our front line almost every day!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_12_GeneralBlunt_NPC=And now, demons?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_13_GeneralBlunt_NPC=It may not be your war, but if you want my support, you'll help me win it.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_14_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Take a rest, we'll talk soon. I'll be on the wall.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_15_Player_Selfpres=Win a war? Really?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_AfterBattle_16_Player_Authority=Maybe we can just win a battle or two. You know - change the tide?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_1_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Here you are…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_2_GeneralBlunt_NPC=…did you think about my offer?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_3_Player_Authority=Is there any way to reassure you about the situation on the front…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_4_Player_Authority=…so you would agree to take a few days for the vote?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_5_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Actually, there might be.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_6_GeneralBlunt_NPC=I had an operation in mind, but it's risky - some would say it's suicide.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_7_GeneralBlunt_NPC=And yet, for a powerful group of heroes…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_8_Player_Mean=Spare us the soft soap, General. We know what we're worth.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_9_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Fine. There is a place - a ruin, but well placed, on high ground. Glendale Castle.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_10_GeneralBlunt_NPC=It's in enemy hands for now.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_11_Player_Cynical=Now I understand why you call this insanely risky.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_12_GeneralBlunt_NPC=A food convoy is headed there as we speak.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_13_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Taking it right out from under the enemy's nose would deal a massive blow to their morale.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_22_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Meanwhile, I'll lead an attack on some enemy reinforcements approaching from the south.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_23_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Strike true, my friends!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_24_Player_Authority=Strike true, General!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_1_Player_Authority=Captain Ashdown!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_2_CaptainAshdown_NPC=You're back? How did it go?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_5_Player_ChoiceA=It's done. The soldiers in Glendale Castle are going to be hungry.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_7_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceA=You really don't disappoint.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_8_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceB=What? How did that happen?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_9_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceB=So no trouble on the way?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_12_Player_ChoiceC=They had civilian prisoners, from your clan.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_14_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceC=I see. So you saved them?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_17_Player_ChoiceE=No. They were killed during the fight.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_18_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceE=Shame.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_19_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Well, it is war, after all.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_23_Player_Authority=Is the general back?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_20_Player_ChoiceF=Yes, we did.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_21_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceF=Ah, well done.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_22_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceF=True to your reputation.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_24_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Not yet.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_25_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Give her some time, the Salamander is tough, but her old bones shake in the cold.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_26_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Get some rest. This is far from over.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_27_Player_Cynical=Old bones, eh?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_28_Player_Insight=Do I sense a touch of ambition there?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_29_Player_Authority=Don't jump to conclusions!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_AfterBridgeAttack_30_Player_Pragmatism=He's right about one thing: we need a rest.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth2_1_Player_Authority=What? He's back!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth2_2_Sessroth_NPC=Did you really think you could simply get rid of me?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth2_3_Player_Insight=You're not fully regenerated - we're wearing you down!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth2_4_Sessroth_NPC=Optimistic, are you? Let's see how many times you can survive me.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth2_5_Player_Insight=We need to destroy the other pillars. He clearly doesn't like it.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth2_6_Sessroth_NPC=Ah, someone here thinks they're smart!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_MeetSessroth2_7_Sessroth_NPC=Kill them!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_Banter_4PillarsDown_1_Player_Selfpres=What now?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_Banter_4PillarsDown_2_Player_Cynical=Let's see what's left of Sessroth's Gate.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_1_Player_Authority=The place is a wreck, but the Gate still seems functional.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_2_Player_Selfpres=We can't go on fighting him forever.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_3_Player_Arcana=He can't die here, his soul just returns to his plane and he simply respawns.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_4_Player_Selfpres=Are you suggesting we go into the Demon Realms?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_5_Player_Authority=How do we even do that?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_6_Player_Arcana=The Guardian?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_7_Player_Selfpres=This is insane! What if we find ourselves stuck again?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_8_Player_Authority=Do you want to wait for Sessroth to return again, and again?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_9_Player_Arcana=Let's do it!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_10_Player_Pragmatic=I'm ready!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_11_Player_Authority=For Solasta!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_JumpIntoHell_12_Player_Selfpres=I can't believe I'm doing this!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_1_Sessroth_NPC=Unbelievable. You Solastans are even crazier than we are.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_2_Player_Authority=You can't run any more, Sessroth!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_3_Sessroth_NPC=Oh, but I'm perfectly happy here at home - and ready to receive friends.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_4_Sessroth_NPC=Such as…
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_5_Sessroth_NPC=…a business acquaintance from Tirmar.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_6_Player_Einar=No!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_7_Player_History=Sorr-Tarr?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_8_Player_Einar=It can't be!
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_9_Player_Arcana=It's just an avatar, not a deity, but still…
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_10_Player_Pragmatic=We knew it would be dangerous.
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_11_Sessroth_NPC=Are you done?
Narration/&DLC3_Palace_TheFinalCountdown_12_Sessroth_NPC=Shall we dance?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_1_Grimhild_NPC=Well met, Heroes of the Rift!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_2_CynicOrElse_Normal=Well met!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_3_Grimhild_NPC=I am Grimhild Darkhead, of Clan Goldentongue.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_4_Grimhild_NPC=You must remember Galar, he told the whole family about you!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_4b_Player=Of course, we fought together in the Marches.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_4c_Grimhild_NPC=Well, this is our humble trading house.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_5_HighestCharismaIfNotCynic_Flowery=We haven't seen Galar for a while. How is he?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_6_Grimhild_NPC=Galar is fine. He's on the road, as always.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_8_Grimhild_NPC=But his nephew, Gilmar, his caravan went missing.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_10_DwarfOrAcademicOrElse_Normal=Did you go to the authorities?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_11_Grimhild_NPC=Of course, the answer is always the same: the tunnel is blocked!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_12_DwarfOrAcademicOrElse_Normal=The one supposed to be heated by lava ducts?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_13_Grimhild_NPC=Yeah, that one.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_14_Grimhild_NPC=Gilmar knows his roads.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_15_Grimhild_NPC=And the timing is suspicious, with the election in full swing.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_18_Any_Normal=We heard.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_19_Grimhild_NPC=Sure, but what you don't know…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_20_Grimhild_NPC=…is that house Goldentongue wants Gilmar to run.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_21_Grimhild_NPC=Since you're friends of the family…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_22_DwarfOrHighesCharism_Normal=You want us to go look for him?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_23_DwarfOrHighesCharism_Normal=Of course, my friends, go inside and rest.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_24_DwarfOrHighesCharism_Normal=Stay in the light, my friends.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_NOAUDIO_AskHospitality=Can we ask for your hospitality?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetMerchant_26_Grimhild=If you could, we would owe you.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lava_1_Survivor_NPC=Enemies… They sealed the ducts… lava must flow…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_1_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=A timely arrival!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_2_SellswordOrHighestInt_Normal=We heard time was of the essence!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_3_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=Lisbath made it, I gather?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_4_SellswordOrHighestInt_Normal=Yes, as it happens, we're old friends.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_5_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=In the name of my people, many thanks!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_6_SellswordOrHighestInt_Normal=Our pleasure!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_7_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=Uncle Galar was right about your strength! But what are you doing here?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_8_SellswordOrHighestInt_Normal=We're just helping the clan, there's trouble in there.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_9_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=Hah! Say it: Perlevinn and Ettiven keep dithering.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_10_SellswordOrHighestInt_Normal=It's possible they value their house more than the clan, yes.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_11_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=Forgetting the clan's pledge to maintain a safe path through the mountains.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_13_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=Keskainen must ensure all citizens can freely flow in and out of Turvaamalinn.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_14_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=And Perlevinn and Ettiven ought to know that!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_15_HighestIntorInsight10_Success_Normal=And with the election coming up…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_16_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=If just one elector cannot access the ballot boxes, the election is null!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_17_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=Anyway, maybe the electors would choose someone from another house…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_17b_Player_NPC=Like house Goldentongue. Sure, why not?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_18b_Gilmar=If I can ever pass through this damn tunnel!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_18c_Player=We repaired the lava flow.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_18d_Gilmar=Ah, so we need a good eight to ten hours for the ice to melt.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_19_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=Let's rest a while. Then you should find Kara and tell her what you learned.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_20_GilmarGoldentongue_NPC=As regent, she must inform the electors so they can vote in full responsibility.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_1_KaraWise_Head_NPC=My friends! I heard of your great deeds.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_2_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal=Well, we did our best to make the election possible.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_3_KaraWise_Head_NPC=The last missing electors are entering through the tunnel as we speak.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_3b_KaraWise_Head_NPC=As soon as the quorum is complete, I shall call upon them to vote and elect a new head for Clan Keskainen.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_4_KaraWise_Head_NPC=The candidates are Brodir Steelheart of House Perlevinn, Valdi Boldhand of House Ettiven…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_4a_KaraWise_Head_NPC=…and Gilmar Goldentongue, of House Goldentongue.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_4b_KaraWise_Head_NPC=Now, since you were witnesses during the recent unpleasantness…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_5_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Formal=A nice way to put it.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_6_KaraWise_Head_NPC=I would like to hear what you have to say about those who claim to lead our clan.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_7_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Your people will vote, not us.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_8_KaraWise_Head_NPC=It is my duty to inform the electors of the truth, under Pakri's watch.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10a_written_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Ettiven and the Soraks
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10b_written_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Perlevinn and the Heat Generator
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10c_written_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Tunnel Maintenance Failure
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10d_written_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Perlevinn and the Brigands
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10e_written_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Nothing to add
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10a_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Ettiven has been infiltrated by Soraks…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_11a_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=…and yet didn't want to face the truth.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_12a_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=They only believe in profit.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_12a_Valdi=Preposterous!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10b_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Perlevinn built a clandestine heat generator…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_11b_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=…to preserve their garden, disregarding their duty to the clan.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_11b_Brodir=Outrageous!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10c_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Neither Perlevinn nor Ettiven took charge of the tunnel's maintenance…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_11c_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=…thus breaking the pledge of Keskainen…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_12c_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=…and causing the death many of Goldentongue's soldiers in the caravan's attack.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_12c_Gilmar=Damn right.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10d_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=Perlevinn agreed with local brigands to block the quarry and blame house Ettiven…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_11d_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=…at the expense of the workers in the Low City…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_12d_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=…who were terrorized and killed in skirmishes.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_12d_Valdi=Shame!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_10e_DiplomatOrSpyOrElse_Normal=We've said all we had to say.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_18a_KaraWise_Head_NPC=Many thanks for your testimony! May the owl watch over you!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_18b_KaraWise_Head_NPC=It is time for the Keskainen Vartmerkint to elect a chief…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_19_KaraWise_Head_NPC=…who will carry out the duty to name a Speaker for the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_1_Rhuad_NPC=Hello, adventurers! Need anything from the Scavengers?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_2_Player_Authority=You must be Rhuad. Master Goodcheer told us to come here for information.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_3_Rhuad_NPC=Is it Master now? She never was very humble, our dear Violet.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_4_Lena_NPC=Are you the Sorak killers? Annie mentioned you.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_5_Player_Authority=That's us. And Sorak business is why we're here.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_6_Lena_NPC=Damn!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_7_Lena_NPC=My former mentor, Hector - he disappeared in there, taken by orcs.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_8_Rhuad_NPC=We never found him, but we found Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_9_Rhuad_NPC=Violet thought he was one of them.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_10_Lena_NPC=Violet also blew the whole place up.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_11_Rhuad_NPC=It happens, darling. Who wouldn't toss a fireball at a bunch of Soraks?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_12_Lena_NPC=Don't mind him.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_13_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Who are you again?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_14_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=You fought Soraks?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_15_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Tell us about Hector.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_16_Player_ChoiceA=Can you tell us your names again?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_17_Lena_NPC=I'm Lena, and this is Rhuad…
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_17b_Lena_NPC=…my dear husband and quartermaster of our little Scavenger outpost.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_18_Lena_NPC=The place is used as an outpost and relay station for the Badlands and the Marches.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_19_Lena_NPC=You can shop at our stores, sleep in our camp - and, of course, do business with the Scavengers here.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_20_Player_ChoiceB=You said you fought Soraks?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_21_Player_ChoiceB=Nobody believed in them back then.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_22_Rhuad_NPC=I had my doubts, but after the orcs, the spiders…
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_23_Rhuad_NPC=…the things we faced couldn't be anything else.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_24_Rhuad_NPC=We never found Hector, so Violet said it couldn't be a coincidence.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_25_Lena_NPC=Because she didn't know him.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_26_Lena_ChoiceC=He was a seasoned Scavenger when we arrived here. We had a dozen people with us.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_27_Lena_NPC=Orcs attacked us while we were setting up the camp.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_28_Lena_NPC=One of us ran to Caer Cyflen for help, and Annie sent us four adventurers.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_29_Rhuad_NPC=That was me, along with Violet, Vigdis, and Garrad.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_30_Rhuad_NPC=We cleaned the place out as much as we could, until… well, until it collapsed.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_31_Player_Authority=Actually, we're looking for anything related to a Manacalon wizard who taught in Telema.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_32_Rhuad_NPC=There's not much left. Just one magic door we could never open, which resisted the collapse.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_33_Player_Authority=I guess we'll take our chances.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_34_Rhuad_NPC=As you wish.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Meeting_35_Player_Authority=Who was Hector, exactly?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_EnteringGhostRoom_01=See those runes on the wall?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_EnteringGhostRoom_02=They seem inactive.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_EnteringGhostRoom_03=More Manacalon shenanigans - I love it!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_EnteringHighLab_01=Oh-oh.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_EnteringHighLab_02=Damn cultists.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter1_Player_Any=Rest In Peace!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter1_Player_Starter=Look at that! The town was literally built on this glacier!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter2_Curious_Starter=And this tower must be very old to be stuck in the ice like that.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter3_Cynical_Starter=Reminds me of the tower at Caer Lem.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter4_Curious_Starter=Actually, this place is too far from the Aer Elai to be affected by the Cataclysm.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter5_Cynical_Starter=Fine, you're smarter than me.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_EnteringLowLab_01=Finally, a room that's not smashed to pieces!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_EnteringLowLab_02=And Exonaïka's sigil everywhere. This is it!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_FoundInstructions_01=This Minor Gate is not what it seems…
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_FoundInstructions_02=This is going to be fun!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter1_Misouk=Follow me!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter2_Misouk=The clan's necropolis has been carved into the glacier itself.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter3_Misouk=Our ancestors built protections for the vault.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter4_Misouk=There are three slabs that control the three gates blocking the access.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter5_Misouk=They must be activated at the same time.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter6_Misouk=Which means that we must split up to step on them all at the same time.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter7_Misouk=The vault is on the other side.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter_Guard01=Welcome, Heroes of the Rift!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter_Guard02=This is Lady Vigdis' room.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter_Guard03=This guest room is occupied by Lady Ragnhild.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_1_Player_Authority=It's a peaceful night.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_2_CaptainAshdown_NPC=At last. Our soldiers can certainly use some relief.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_3_CaptainAshdown_NPC=I wanted to tell you about something.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_4_CaptainAshdown_NPC=You've seen General Blunt in command.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_5_Player_Authority=A true warrior, for sure.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_6_Player_Selfpres=That we did. She's a character.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_7_Player_Mean=A real piece of work.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_8_CaptainAshdown_NPC=I'm afraid she's not going to give you what you want.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_9_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Unless you intend to take over the whole of Gallivan.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_10_CaptainAshdown_NPC=We don't really have time for that.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_11_CaptainAshdown_NPC=My point exactly.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_12_Player_Authority=What do you suggest?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_13_CaptainAshdown_NPC=The clan needs another chief.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_14_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Someone who would have the interests of the Alliance at heart.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_15_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Someone who would honor the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_16_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=You want the job?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_17_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=What about the war?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_18_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=What if we tell her?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_19_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=You want us to kill her?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_20_Player_ChoiceA=You want to be chief?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_21_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceA=You would have my full support at the parliament.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_22_Player_ChoiceB=What about holding the front line? The castle?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_23_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceB=I would also need your help, but I have a better, more efficient plan, so you won't waste any more time here.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_24_Player_ChoiceC=You're not worried that we might tell her about your ambitions?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_25_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceC=I'm simply offering you a solution.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_26_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceC=If you refuse, I'll continue to serve my clan anyway.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_27_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceC=If you tell her… I'm already dead.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_28_Player_ChoiceD=To be clear, you want us to kill General Blunt?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_29_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceD=I know the Salamander is never going to step down. She'd rather die.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_30_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceD=She must be back now, near the beacon.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CampfirePlot_31_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceD=It's your choice.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_1_GeneralBlunt_NPC=You're here? I heard about your mission.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_2_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Anything urgent? I didn't expect to talk more until the morning.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_3_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=We'll talk later.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_4_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Captain Ashdown is a traitor!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_5_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=You must step down.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_6_Player_ChoiceA=Alright, we'll talk in the morning then.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_7_Player_ChoiceB=This can't wait!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_8_Player_ChoiceB=Captain Ashdown asked us to murder you in exchange for his support as future clan chief.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_9_GeneralBlunt_ChoiceB=What?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_10_Player_ChoiceB=Don't underestimate the possibility of Sorak corruption.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_11_GeneralBlunt_ChoiceB=My most trusted officer…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_12_GeneralBlunt_ChoiceB=Can you take care of his arrest?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_12b_Player_ChoiceB=He's your second in command. You don't want to do it yourself?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_12c_GeneralBlunt_ChoiceB=I have a meeting with my officers…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_12d__GeneralBlunt_ChoiceB=…officers who are actually working to win us this war instead of plotting against their general.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_12e_GeneralBlunt_ChoiceB=So, no, I won't have time for that, not now.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_13_Player_ChoiceB=You realize he might fight us?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_14_GeneralBlunt_ChoiceB=Then so be it.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_15_Player_ChoiceC=You are relieved of command, General.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_16_GeneralBlunt_ChoiceC=What are you talking about?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_17_Player_ChoiceC=Captain Ashdown will be a more… reasonable clan chief.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_DenounceCaptain_18_GeneralBlunt_ChoiceC=Damn traitor! Guards!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_1_CaptainAshdown_NPC=You did it!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_2_Player_Authority=What matters most to us is the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_3_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Yes, yes, the amulet.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_4_CaptainAshdown_NPC=I'm the only one capable of succeeding General Blunt.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_5_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Considering we're at war, the clan will elect me without any hesitation.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_6_CaptainAshdown_NPC=The passing of the Claw will be swift.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_7_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Call on me any time at the parliament, I'll come and vote according to your wishes.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_8_Player_Authority=We're counting on that. So, what about the assault on Glendale Castle?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_9_CaptainAshdown_NPC=My plan is set, it will be formality.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_10_CaptainAshdown_NPC=I have acquired an artifact that will allow me to summon precious allies.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_KilledGeneral_11_CaptainAshdown_NPC=When you're ready, take the east road and I'll meet you there.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_1_CaptainAshdown_NPC=You're back. Did you take a decision?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_2_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=You're under arrest!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_3_Player_ChoiceA=Not yet.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_4_Player_ChoiceB=We did. We can't support you.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_5_Player_ChoiceB=You are under arrest for sedition!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_6_CaptainAshdown_NPC=You fools! But fine, I won't fight.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_7_CaptainAshdown_NPC=I'd rather die than be locked up in my own jails!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_8_Player_Authority=You're leaving us no choice then.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_9_Player_ChoiceC=What you propose is treason!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_10_Player_ChoiceC=There is only one penalty for that crime.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_11_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceC=We fought together, and now you want to kill me?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ArrestCaptain_12_CaptainAshdown_ChoiceC=You're not the heroes I took you for.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ReadyToAttack_1_GeneralBlunt_NPC=So it is done?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ReadyToAttack_2_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Thank you for your help.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ReadyToAttack_2b_Player=He surrendered. It's not our place to judge and condemn him.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ReadyToAttack_3_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Those damn Soraks are trying to do us what they did on Tirmar.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ReadyToAttack_4_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Making us kill each other.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ReadyToAttack_5_Player_Authority=We've seen it many times now.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ReadyToAttack_6_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Anyway, the plans are set for the attack on Glendale Castle.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ReadyToAttack_7_GeneralBlunt_NPC=I'll meet you there.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ReadyToAttack_8_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Stay in the light, my friends!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_1_GeneralBlunt_NPC=This is it.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_2_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Our objective is to capture or kill an enemy general who is hiding in the castle.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_3_GeneralBlunt_NPC=But first we need to take control of the surrounding area.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_4_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Once you open the castle's main gate, we'll launch the full assault.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_5_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Use force or stealth, as you see fit.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_6_GeneralBlunt_NPC=One more thing…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_7_GeneralBlunt_NPC=The traitor you caught had a document describing a secret passage in the walls.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_8_GeneralBlunt_NPC=You could use it to get right into the inner castle.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_9_GeneralBlunt_NPC=But then you'd be alone inside.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssault_10_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Good luck.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_1_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Masterful!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_2_GeneralBlunt_NPC=I'm impressed - I've never seen such a display of power.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_3_Player_Friendly=You trying to make us blush, General?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_4_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Apologies, I'm rarely humbled by anyone.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_5_GeneralBlunt_NPC=I didn't foresee that we would gain the upper hand on the front line after just a few days.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_6_GeneralBlunt_NPC=Thanks to you, that is now a reality.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_7_Player_Authority=We care about peace in the Eastern Kingdoms…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_8_Player_Authority=…but you know why we're here.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_9_GeneralBlunt_NPC=I haven't forgotten.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_10_GeneralBlunt_NPC=And yes, now I will have the time to come and vote at the parliament.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattieIsWon_11_GeneralBlunt_NPC=I will consider your opinions carefully when it's time to cast my vote.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_1_GallivanOfficer_NPC=Halt! Friend or foe?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_2_Player_Authority=We're not here to fight you.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_1b_GallivanOfficer_NPC=You're not from the Snow Alliance, I can see that.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_2b_Player_Authority=Still, your prisoners will freeze to death in those cages.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_1c_GallivanOfficer_NPC=They're enemy combatants, their health is not our problem.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_1d_GallivanOfficer_NPC=So what do you want?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_3_GallivanOfficer_NPC=What do you want, then?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_4_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=You should return home
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_5_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Surrender or die.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=To buy your prisoners' freedom.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_7_Player_ChoiceA=We strongly suggest that you return home.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_8_Player_ChoiceA=Your destination is surrounded by Snow Alliance troops.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_9_Player_ChoiceA=You'll find only death there.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_10_GallivanOfficer_NPC=You're right. I knew this mission was doomed.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_11_GallivanOfficer_NPC=You think we're afraid of the Snow Alliance? You're wrong!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_12_Player_ChoiceB=We want you to surrender immediately.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_13_Player_ChoiceB=Refuse, and you'll die.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_14_Player_ChoiceC=We'd like to buy your prisoners' freedom.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_15_Player_ChoiceC=How about a hundred gold pieces?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_16_Player_ChoiceC=How about a thousand gold pieces?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_17_Player_ChoiceC=How about five thousand gold pieces?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_18_GallivanOfficer_NPC=What a joke! We won't be corrupted by agents of the Snow Alliance!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_19_GallivanOfficer_NPC=Kill them all!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_20_GallivanOfficer_NPC=Well, we could use the money, for sure…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_21_GallivanOfficer_NPC=This war doesn't make sense, anyway.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_22_GallivanOfficer_NPC=Fine, keep the prisoners, we'll disappear and die another day.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_ConvoyNego_23_Player=A wise decision. Go in peace.
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_EnterHell_1_Player_Selfpres=By all the gods…
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_EnterHell_2_Player_Selfpres=We made a huge mistake!
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_EnterHell_3_Player_Authority=Come on, let's find this Sessroth and make him pay.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_1_Beric_NPC=My friends! It is so good to see you again.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_2_Player_Paladin=Likewise, Marshal!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_3_Player_Paladin=We came as fast as we could.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_4_Beric_NPC=Great thanks. You must have many questions.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_5_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Is the Crown going to remain here?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=How's the situation with Gallivan?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Soraks triggered the war?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_8_Player_ChoiceA=You'll keep the Crown of the Magister on display here?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_9_Player_ChoiceA=Exactly. Even if it is just an old relic now…
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_10_Beric_NPC=…it serves our task as guardians of the memory of Solasta.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_11_Player_ChoiceB=How are things going with the Kingdom of Gallivan?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_12_Beric_ChoiceB=It is not an all-out war yet, just skirmishes on the border.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_13_Beric_ChoiceB=I hear they are also attacking the lands of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_14_Player_ChoiceC=Is it confirmed that Soraks control the Kingdom of Gallivan?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_15_Beric_ChoiceC=There is not much space for doubt anymore…
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_16_Beric_ChoiceC=…though we do not know how they do it how exactly.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_17_Beric_ChoiceC=Corruption, coercion, or plain replacement.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_18_Player_Paladin=After all, we did to close the Rift…
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_19_Player_Paladin=…to think they're still around, that's really depressing.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_20_Beric_NPC=You did prevent a massive invasion.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_21_Beric_NPC=Without you, we wouldn't be here anymore.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_22_Beric_NPC=Which is why I asked for your help.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_23_Beric_NPC=You must remember when the Antiquarians left the Legacy Council, as the war started…
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_24_Beric_NPC=…yet the Church of Einar has ties with the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_25_Player_Cynical=One of our renowned clerics, Vigdis Kaikonnen, belongs to one of their oldest clans.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_26_Beric_NPC=While she was here in the Einareum, her father was found dead.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_27_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=You think Soraks killed him?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_28_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Who is she exactly?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_29_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=What's with the Snow Alliance?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_30_Player_ChoiceA=How do you tie this death to the Soraks?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_31_Beric_NPC=Lord Kaikonnen was kidnapped, kept in a hidden house…
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_31b_Beric_NPC=…and notes had been taken on his behavior, his way of speaking, his taste in food…
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_32_Player_ChoiceA=So they could learn to mimic him!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_33_Beric_NPC=It looks like it. One of his captains found him. He killed a couple of Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_34_Beric_NPC=But sadly, the lord could not be resurrected.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_35_Player_ChoiceB=What can you tell us about Vigdis?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_36_Beric_ChoiceB=Well, she is an experienced battle cleric from the Order of the Shield…
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_37_Beric_ChoiceB=…she took part in multiple expeditions to the Badlands.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_38_Beric_ChoiceB=She is wise, strong, a paragon of our creed.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_39_Beric_ChoiceB=I am afraid she is currently a tad shaken by her father's demise.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_40_Player_ChoiceC=Do you think the Soraks aim to take over the Snow Alliance like they did Gallivan?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_41_Beric_ChoiceC=It is their way, therefore yes, I am afraid so.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_42_Beric_ChoiceC=The difference is that now we know they are here…
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_43_Beric_ChoiceC=…and how they operate.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_44_Player_Authority=We have to go and investigate - we can't have the Principality surrounded by Sorak puppets!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_45_Beric_NPC=Lady Vigdis and her escort leave for home tonight.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_46_Beric_NPC=I would feel more comfortable if you could be with her.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_47_Beric_NPC=They could be after her, too - and possibly the other clan chiefs.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_48_Beric_NPC=The politics of the Snow Alliance are complicated. You will have to swim with sharks.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_49_Player_Cynical=I think we can deal with that. We survived the Legacy Council, after all.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_50_Beric_NPC=I am sure of that.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_51_Beric_NPC=You are heroes of Masgarth. Your reputation precedes you and your mission is sacred - let no one keep you from your duty!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_52_Player_Authority=You can count on us, Marshal!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_53_Beric_NPC=Thank you!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_54_Beric_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder1_Elder_NPC=Ah, back already? Is it done?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder2_Player_Authority=Actually, no.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder3_Player_Authority=We spoke to Greybear. He doesn't sound like the kind of elf you described.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder4_Elder_NPC=Really? What lies did he feed you?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder5_Player_Authority=The old Manacalon building down there - do you go there sometimes?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder6_Elder_NPC=I see…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder7_Elder_NPC=Are you suggesting that I'm a shapeshifter? Sorr-Akkath, or even worse?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder8_Player_Authority=That's what we're here to find out.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder9_Elder_NPC=I told you this elf was twisted… but it's your choice.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder10_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=We'll know when you're dead.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder11_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=We'll investigate.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder12_Player_ChoiceA=Once you're dead, we'll know if we were wrong.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder13_Player_ChoiceB=We need to investigate further. We can't just risk being wrong.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder14_Elder_NPC=As you wish.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_1_Player_Friendly=Oh, no…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_2_Player_Pragmatic=So much for casting a vote…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_3_Player_Friendly=We failed him…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_4_Player_Pragmatic=There's no need for that now. We need to focus on the mission.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_5_Advisor_NPC=Master Sharpmind!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_6_Player_Friendly=We found out too late, I'm sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_7_Advisor_NPC=It's not your fault… I was there too, and I saw nothing.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_8_Player_Friendly=I hate to ask you this now, but…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_9_Player_Friendly=He didn't have an heir?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_10_Advisor_NPC=You mean, for the Pact of the Claw?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_11_Advisor_NPC=He had planned something, with Dyssalim.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_12_Advisor_NPC=Obviously, he can't take the oath.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_13_Advisor_NPC=So it's going to be me. I will answer the call for the vote at the parliament. You can trust me.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_14_Advisor_NPC=We'll see you there, then.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ElderIsDead_15_Advisor_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenQuarry_AskedAboutQuarry_1_Player=Do you know how to access the lava tunnels without using the well's elevator?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenQuarry_AskedAboutQuarry_2_Citizen=There's an old gallery in the quarry, but the area is locked.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenQuarry_AskedAboutQuarry_3_Player=We're looking into the disappearances. It would really help if you had any idea how to get in.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenQuarry_AskedAboutQuarry_4_Citizen_Persuasion_SUCCESS=Well, there is a crate you can push to sneak in, but I didn't tell you, understand?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenQuarry_AskedAboutQuarry_5_Citizen_Persuasion_FAILURE=Get lost! You people are from above, and you come here asking for our help? Why don't you help us?!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenQuarry_Meet_1_Player=Sorry, I can't help you, but I'm sure you'll find a way.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenQuarry_Meet_2_Citizen=Those from above. They won't help us!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenQuarry_Meet_3_Citizen=We're stuck here. No quarry, no tunnel!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenBeasts_AskedAboutBeasts_1_Player=Did you see the beasts?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenBeasts_AskedAboutBeasts_2_Citizen=Furry, with long, sharp fangs - we didn't stand a chance!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenBeasts_AskedAboutBeasts_3_Player=Didn't the guards help you?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_CitizenBeasts_AskedAboutBeasts_4_Citizen=They only care about their damn election!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_UndercoverGuard_AskedAboutWell_1_Player=What happened here?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_UndercoverGuard_AskedAboutWell_2_Guard=We acted under the authority of House Ettiven.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_UndercoverGuard_AskedAboutWell_3_Player=I mean, did you just destroy the well?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_UndercoverGuard_AskedAboutWell_3_PlayerNOAUDIO=What happened here?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_UndercoverGuard_AskedAboutWell_4_Player_Insight_SUCCESS=For Arivad!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_UndercoverGuard_AskedAboutWell_5_Guard_Insight_FAILURE=This is none of your business. Leave now.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_SecretGenerator_1_Guard=Hey! You shouldn't be here!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_SecretGenerator_2_Player=What is this machine?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_SecretGenerator_3_Guard=…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_SecretGenerator_4_Player=They are hijacking the lava flow!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_SecretGenerator_5_Player=To keep the Perlevinn gardens in perfect condition!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_SecretGenerator_6_Guard_Intimidation_SUCCESS=Don't tell anyone, please. We just obeyed Brodir's command!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_SecretGenerator_7_Guard_Intimidation_FAILURE=Perlevinn must prevail. We cannot let you report this!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Banter00_Arrival1=This is it, the elven settlements.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Banter00_Arrival2=Wonderful.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Banter00_Arrival3=Lots of high elves for a sylvan place.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_1_Crier_CitizenQuarry=Ettiven, Perlevinn, all the same!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_2_Crier_CitizenQuarry=When will this damn election be finished?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_3_Crier_CitizenQuarry=First the tunnel, now the quarry! It's enough!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_4_Crier_CitizenQuarry=He's walking around in his beautiful gardens, but no one to come and clear the tunnel!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_5_Crier_CitizenQuarry=No matter how hard we dig, this tunnel is far too solid.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_6_Crier_CitizenQuarry=Turvaamalinn is freezing to death!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_7_Crier_CitizenQuarry=What are they waiting for to fix the heating system?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_8_Crier_CitizenQuarry=The ice in the tunnel will not melt by itself!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_MagicSchoolPlate=Access restricted: old magic school from the Manacalon era
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_CitizenFog_1_Citizen01=It's freezing!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_CitizenFog_2_Citizen02=What are they waiting for to turn the heat back on?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_CitizenFog_3_Citizen01=I've heard something about the tunnel, but I'm not sure…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_UndercoverGuard_MeetTemple_1_Guard=I will do what is necessary, my lord.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermoutain_UndercoverGuard_MeetTemple_2_Guard=Out of my way, strangers!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_Guard_Welcome=Welcome to Turvaamalinn.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_CitizenBeasts_Approaching=There are beasts in the quarry. They attacked us!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Carcasses1=What's with all the dead animals?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Carcasses2=I guess it means we're getting close…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Carcasses3=By all the gods, what a stench!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DoorRuins=This door is quite mysterious, but it's locked.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Pillar=That's clearly not sylvan.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_DoorHighDistrict=It must be some kind of museum. Let's avoid trouble.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Valley_01=You said it was called "the Dominion"?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Valley_02=Indeed, a large valley, completely isolated, just west of Coparann.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Valley_03=So there's new business to be done?
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Valley_04=Well, it is still a dangerous place, but I suppose Galar Goldentongue will not miss the opportunity.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Attack_01_Player=Ambush!
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Attack_02_Vigdis=Soraks!
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Attack_03_Vigdis=Take cover!
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Attack_04_Player=Look out for that spellcaster!
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack_01_Vigdis=Did you see that?
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack_02_Player=What kind of monster was that?
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack_03_Player=New kinds of Soraks!
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack_04_Vigdis=We need to rest. Let's set up camp.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_1_Misouk_NPC=Welcome home, my lady.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_2_Vigdis_NPC=Ah, Misouk, it's good to see you.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_3_Misouk_NPC=I'm sorry about your father, my lady. We'll find the murderers, I swear it.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_4_Vigdis_NPC=Yes, yes, in due time, my friend.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_4b_Vigdis_NPC=We will, together. I promise you, justice will be done.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_4c_Vigdis_NPC=Now is the time to mourn.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_5_Vigdis_NPC=We have guests, the heroes who won the battle at the Rift.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_6_Misouk_NPC=That's a damn good curriculum. Welcome to Kaupaapunki.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_7_Vigdis_NPC=Misouk is my…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_8_Misouk_NPC=Security officer.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_9_Vigdis_NPC=So, I suppose everybody's here?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_10_Misouk_NPC=The whole clan.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_11_Vigdis_NPC=As expected…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_12_Vigdis_NPC=Well, my friends, consider yourselves at home.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_13_Vigdis_NPC=My people's hospitality is well known.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Arriving_14_Vigdis_NPC=I would like to… see my father, before the ceremony.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_GuardTextBanter_01=Nice weather, eh?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_GuardTextBanter_02=We watch…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_GuardTextBanter_03=My watch has just started…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_GuardTextBanter_04=I miss hunting in the snow.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_LokanBanter_01=Strike true!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_LokanBanter_02=Make yourselves at home.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_LokanBanter_03=The Kaikonnens are the best.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_1_Innkeeper_NPC=Well met, strangers!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_2_Innkeeper_NPC=What's your poison?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_3_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=We need a room.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_4_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=How's the beer?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_5_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Any news?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=We need to go.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_7_Player_Any=We'd like to rest.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_8_Player_Cynical=Separate beds.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_9_Innkeeper_NPC=Eh, as long as you pay, you do you.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_10_Player_Any=How's your beer?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_11_Innkeeper_NPC=Eh, dark, bitter, and strong.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_12_Innkeeper_NPC=Better than their shitty drink they brew in the south.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_13_Player_NPC=You bet.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_14_Player_ChoiceC=What news?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_15_Innkeeper_NPC=Our lord is dead. Murdered. Damn Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_16_Player_ChoiceC=We heard.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_17_Player_ChoiceC=We were just about to go.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_18_Innkeeper_NPC=See ya next time, then!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_19_Innkeeper_NPC=Enjoy your four beds.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_20_Player_ChoiceC=We're guests of Lady Vigdis.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Inn_21_Innkeeper_NPC=Yeah, nice try.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_GettingBackRuins=We should be able to open the door next to that weird pillar now.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_TraitorWaitingAtDoor=If you don't mind, I'll be waiting here.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_traitorAmbushEnd1=We were tricked!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_traitorAmbushEnd2=I bet this was a diversion to keep us away from the settlement. Let's go back, now!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_LordsTomb_1_Player_Selfpres=We need to find the murderer.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_LordsTomb_7_Player_Maraike=May you rest in the arms of Maraike.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_HiddenDragon=Dear gods, there was another dragon in there!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_KilledFakeElder=We need to find the real Elder, quickly!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter6_Player_Any=Olaf the Yellow King.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter7_Player_Any=Taylor the Swift maiden.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Well_Berghild_Approach=Everything is under control. Go back inside the city.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_BrotherTextBanter_01=Please find the culprits.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_BrotherTextBanter_02=Father now rests with our ancestors.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_CousinTextBanter_01=Keep me updated on your investigation.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_CousinTextBanter_02=Don't forget to look after the Stonebeards.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_UncleTextBanter_01=I was not prepared to outlive my brother.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_UncleTextBanter_02=And now he will join our father in this ice coffin…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_GhostDisappeared=That ghost disappeared…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_WellCollapse_1_Player=Wow, did you hear that?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_WellCollapse_2_Player=An explosion, here?
Narration/&DLC3_VioletsHouse_Banter_Spider=More spiders, really?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder6B_Elder_NPC=Really?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder7B_Elder_NPC=You really believe I'm a shapeshifter? I'm disappointed.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder8B_Player_Authority=That is not a convincing answer.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder9B_Player_Authority=We might go and have a look at that old Manacalon building.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder10B_Elder_NPC_ChoiceA=No you won't.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ConfrontFakeElder10B_Elder_NPC_ChoiceB=Of course, do as you wish, but time is running.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_ShopOwnerBegsHelp=Soraks are attacking the settlement! Please help us!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivaBorder_Banter_BurningTent=We need to find another way.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivaBorder_Alarm=We're under attack!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_Banter_Prisoner=I misjudged you…
Narration/&DLC3_LavaTunnel_First_Fight_Banter=We need to help the soldiers!
Narration/&DLC3_LavaTunnel_Air_Flow_Blocked_1=Would you look at that!
Narration/&DLC3_LavaTunnel_Air_Flow_Blocked_2=This must be the heat generator we're looking for.
Narration/&DLC3_LavaTunnel_Air_Flow_Blocked_3=This should be producing a column of hot air…
Narration/&DLC3_Outside_FightWithYeti=Survivors in the corner! They need our help!
Narration/&DLC3_LavaTunnel_Air_Flow_Blocked_4=That's why the ice in the tunnel is not melting anymore!
Narration/&DLC3_LavaTunnel_Air_Flow_Blocked_5=Did you figure that out by yourself? What a genius!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_1_Player_Friendly=Beryl Stonebeard, is that you?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_2_Beryl_NPC=It's me. Nice to see you again, deputies.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_3_Beryl_NPC=If I may call you that.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_4_Player_Authority=We don't work for the Council anymore.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_5_Beryl_NPC=I suppose you outrank them…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_9_Player_Authority=What are you doing here?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_10_Beryl_NPC=I came to pay respects, in the name of my house, Stonebeard.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_13_Player_NPC=So, what have you been doing since you got back home?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_14_Beryl_NPC=What do you think? I'm a military officer.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_15_Beryl_NPC=My father made sure everybody knows I fought Soraks in the Badlands.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_21_Beryl_NPC=So if you need a hand killing a few of them, my hammer is yours.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_22_Player_NPC=Well, it was nice seeing you again, Beryl.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_23_Beryl_NPC=Same.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Beryl_Hello=Strike true, friends.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_1_Player_Any=We're here to see Lady Vigdis.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_2_Thadeos_NPC=My lady is preparing for a funeral.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_3_Player_Any=We know that.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_4_Player_Any=Good.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_5_NOAUDIO_polite=Open, it's important.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_6_NOAUDIO_mean=What's your problem?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_7_NOAUDIO_highclass=Do you know who we are?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_8_Player_Any=This is important.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_9_Thadeos_NPC=Yes, I'm sure it is.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_10_NPC_Thadeos=What's wrong with you?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_11_Thadeos_NPC=I do not think this is a suitable time to bother my lady.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_12_NPC_Thadeos=Do you know who we are?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_13_NPC_Thadeos=Not family members.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_14_Vigdis_NPC=What's going on, here?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_15_Vigdis_NPC=Your… butler wouldn't let us in.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_16_Vigdis_NPC=Thadeos!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_17_player_Aristo=My lady, this is a private matter, I don't believe strangers should…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_18_Vigdis_NPC=Thadeos! They are my guests of honor!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_19_Vigdis_NPC=I'm sorry, my Lady.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_20_Thadeos_NPC=Please, come in.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_21_Vigdis_NPC=He's a bit old fashioned, you must excuse him.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_22_Player_Friendly=What is this private matter?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_23_Vigdis_NPC=The wake for my father's funeral. I'd like you to be present.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_24_Player_Friendly=Oh, thanks, it's a privilege, my Lady.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_25_Vigdis_NPC=You clearly don't know my family.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_26b_Vigdis_NPC=This is about tradition, not emotion.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeStart_26_Vigdis_NPC=Let's go then. It's showtime.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_1_Vigdis_NPC=Dear friends, family, and honored guests…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_2_Vigdis_NPC=…we are gathered this day to honor my father…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_3_Vigdis_NPC=…our lord Kaikonnen Vartija, protector of Ettilen Vartmerkint.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_4_Player_Friendly=I almost forgot, she's gonna be the new clan chief.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_5_Player_Friendly=Think they're all happy about that?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_6_Player_Any=Who knows?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_7_Player_Friendly=Shhh…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_8_Vigdis_NPC=Kaikonnen Vartija, we bring you to rest in the halls of our ancestors.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_9_Vigdis_NPC=May the gods keep your soul, our fallen lord.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_10_Player_Any=Honor the fallen.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_12_Brother_NPC=Honor the fallen.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_13_Thadeos_NPC=Honor the fallen.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_14_Lokan_NPC=Honor the fallen.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_15_Grunhild_NPC=Honor the fallen.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_16_Vigdis_NPC=From ice you were born…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_17_Vigdis_NPC=…with steel you have ruled…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_18_Vigdis_NPC=…on stone you have fallen…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_19_Vigdis_NPC=…in ice you will rest.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeMid_20_Vigdis_NPC=Farewell… dear father.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeEnd_1_Player_Any=Everything alright?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeEnd_2_Vigdis_NPC=I can't leave the wake now.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeEnd_3_Misouk_NPC=This cannot wait, my lady.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeEnd_4_Vigdis_NPC=Go get the instructions, I'll figure it out.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeEnd_5_Vigdis_NPC=My friends, I need your help with an urgent matter.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeEnd_6_Vigdis_NPC=As you can imagine, I must stay here with my family.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeEnd_7_Vigdis_NPC=Can you join Misouk over there and take care of it?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_WakeEnd_8_Vigdis_NPC=She will explain everything.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_1_Misouk_NPC=Ah, so she sent you.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_2_Player_Any=Your lady trusts us. Why don't you?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_3_Misouk_NPC=It's my job to be wary of strangers.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_4_Misouk_NPC=Anyway, she does trust you, so I will, too.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_5_Player_Authority=Can we get to the point?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_6_Misouk_NPC=Sure. I need your help to fetch something from the clan's necropolis.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Fetch what?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_8_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Why do you need us?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_9_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Who are you, really?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_10_Player_ChoiceA=What is that something you need to fetch?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_11_Misouk_ChoiceA=The Claw amulet of Ettilen Vartmerkint.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_12_Misouk_ChoiceA=Oh, we heard about that.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_12b_Player_ChoiceA=The one Vigdis was supposed to inherit from her father?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_12c_Misouk_ChoiceA=Yes, that one.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_12d_Player_ChoiceA=Any idea why Soraks or demons would be after it?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_12e_Misouk_ChoiceA=As far as I know, it's just a symbol of the power of the clan chief.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_12f_Misouk_ChoiceA=But it is a dragon claw, so maybe it has some magical properties.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_13_Player_ChoiceB=Do you really need our help for such a simple task?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_14_Misouk_ChoiceB=I need three people at least, but moreover, the necropolis has been infiltrated.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_15_Player_ChoiceB=By whom?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_16_Misouk_ChoiceB=I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were the same people who murdered my lord.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_17_Player_ChoiceB=So, you're expecting a fight?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_18_Misouk_ChoiceB=Exactly. And I need more than city guards if I'm going to face a bunch of Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_19_Player_ChoiceC=Are you really a simple security officer?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_20_Misouk_ChoiceC=My title doesn't matter. I'm a faithful servant of house Kaikonnen.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_21_Player_ChoiceC=Yeah, she's a spy.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_22_Misouk_NPC=So, do you agree to help me?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_23_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Why is the amulet hidden?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_24_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=What is this necropolis?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_25_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Why the rush?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_26_Player_ChoiceA=Why is the amulet not on Lord Kaikonnen's body?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_27_Misouk_ChoiceA=That's the point. It should have been.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_28_Misouk_ChoiceA=It has a magical safeguard. You must be sworn in to touch it.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_29_Misouk_ChoiceA=Otherwise it teleports into its safe box, in a vault.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_30_Player_ChoiceA=Which means someone tried to take it.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_31_Misouk_ChoiceB=What can you tell us about the necropolis?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_32_Misouk_ChoiceB=It's ancient, carved in the glacier itself.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_33_Misouk_ChoiceB=It also holds the clan's vault, magically protected.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_34_Misouk_ChoiceB=The safe box for the Claw amulet is in that vault.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_35_Player_ChoiceC=Why is this so urgent?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_36_Misouk_ChoiceC=After the wake, Vigdis must take the oath, she needs the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_37_Misouk_ChoiceC=Otherwise her legitimacy would be… endangered.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_38_Misouk_ChoiceC=If Lord Stonebeard heard that she had lost the amulet…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_39_Player_ChoiceC=He could take over as clan chief?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_40_Misouk_ChoiceC=He could try… legitimately.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_41_Player_ChoiceC=That's a possible motive for murder.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Quest2_Start_42_Misouk_NPC=Are you done? Can we go?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_CitizenTextBanter_01=Lord Marduk told us he will find us a home, then he went outside.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_CitizenTextBanter_02=Yes, we have seen Lord Marduk. He gave us some money for the food.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_CitizenTextBanter_03=Lord Marduk booked us a room, and he went that way to see other refugees.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_CitizenTextBanter_04=I saw their shadow, tall like a house!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_CitizenTextBanter_05=It was too dark to see, but their feet made the ground shake and the ice break!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_CitizenTextBanter_06=I heard their voices, strong, guttural voices, speaking in a foreign language.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_GuardTextBanter_01=The clan's houses are inside the mountain.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_GuardTextBanter_02=For security reasons, we can't let all the refugees in.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_GuardTextBanter_03=You are too late, Lord Marduk has already left the city. Let me show you where he is heading.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_GuardTextBanter_04=If you hurry up, maybe you can catch up with him.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_GuardTextBanter_05=The elevator has been repaired.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_GornTextBanter_01=The amount of refugees is increasing every day.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_NorthernLeaderTextBanter_01=I'm ready. Let's go. There is a location I would like to investigate first.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_NorthernRepresentativeTextBanter_01=I'm too busy right now, sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_NorthernRepresentativeTextBanter_02=I need to understand why so many of our people are coming here for shelter.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_NorthernRepresentativeTextBanter_03=You should talk to Marduk himself.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_NorthernRepresentativeTextBanter_04=Thank you for your help.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_GornTextBanter_02=Find the five clans' representatives, inside the mountain.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_VigdisBanter_01=I'm ready to vote, whenever you can gather the others.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_1_Misouk_NPC=Alright, keep your eyes open.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_2_Player_Any=I don't see any threat.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_3_Misouk_NPC=When I came earlier, I saw shadows and heard voices.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_4_Misouk_NPC=Maybe they're gone, but still, be careful.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_5_Misouk_NPC=Now, the protections.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_6_Misouk_NPC=To access the vault, we need to put pressure on three slabs at the same time.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_7_Player_Pragmatic=Which is why you need at least three people.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_8_Misouk_NPC=Yes, also, the slabs are separated, which means we have to split up.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_9_Player_Selfpres=With possible enemies around? Sounds risky.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_NecropolisExplain_10_Misouk_NPC=We don't have a choice.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Necropolis_Intro_1_Misouk_NPC=This is it!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_1_Player_Authority=You have your answer.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_2_Misouk_NPC=So that's what they look like?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_3_Misouk_NPC=How did they find a way in?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_4_Player_Paladin=That's what they do, that and shapeshifting into anyone.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_5_Misouk_NPC=I hope we got them all.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_6_Misouk_NPC=Anyway, let's finish this. The vault is just here.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_7_Player_Greedy=Is it full of gold?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_8_Misouk_NPC=Most valuables are back in the keep.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_9_Misouk_NPC=The vault was used during war times only.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_10_Misouk_NPC=Of course, I'd appreciate it if you didn't loot what's left in it.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_11_Cynical_NPC=Killjoy.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_1_Player_Authority=It's in the box.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_2_Misouk_NPC=Great, I'll take it if you don't mind.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_3_Player_History=Wait a second, this is a Manacalon box, a pretty one.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_4_Misouk_NPC=I said no looting.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_5_Misouk_NPC=Thank you for the help. I owe you.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_6_Misouk_NPC=I need to bring this to Vigdis right now. She must be worried.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_7_Player_Authority=Hey, we're coming with you.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_8_Misouk_NPC=What, you think I'm one of them?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_9_Player_Authority=We find traitors by the dozen these days, so…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_GetAmulet_10_Misouk_NPC=Fair enough, let's go.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Mines_1_Miner_NPC=Call for help!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Mines_2_Player_Authority=What's going on here?!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Mines_3_Player_Selfpres=More Soraks!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Mines_4_Player_Authority=Looks like this was the right place to go!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_1_Player_Friendly=Are you alright?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_2_Miner_NPC=Yes, thanks, I'll survive.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_3_Player_Authority=Where did they come from?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_4_Miner_NPC=Over there, down the pit we found a hidden passage.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_5_Player_Authority=They came from a tunnel?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_6_Miner_NPC=From a breach in the ice.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_7_Miner_NPC=I saw Thadeos wandering around that area…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_8_Miner_NPC=…I thought he might have found a vein…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_9_Player_Cynical=A butler in a mine, and you think he found gold?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_10_Miner_NPC=I know… I just… wanted to know what was there.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_11_Player_Cynical=And you found a bunch of Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_12_Miner_NPC=We need to alert Lady Vigdis!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_13_Player_Authority=She knows. Will you be strong enough to walk?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_14_Miner_NPC=Of course, I'm a dwarf!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_AfterMineBattle_15_Player_Authority=Then get out of here. It's not safe yet.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_CitizenTextBanter_07=We just ran for our lives and heard a dreadful scream.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_RevealIncubus_1_Thadeos_NPC=You! Help me!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_RevealIncubus_2_Player_Authority=Thadeos?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_RevealIncubus_3_Thadeos_NPC=Get me out of here!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_RevealIncubus_4_Player_Nosy=Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_RevealIncubus_5_Thadeos_NPC=Now I see why the Sorr-Akkath complain about you all the time.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_RevealIncubus_6_Player_Authority=What?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_RevealIncubus_7_Player_Selfpres=They shapeshift, too?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_RevealIncubus_8_Thadeos_NPC=Muhahaha!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_1_Thadeos_NPC=What was that?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_2_Player_Nosy=They're called demons.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_3_Thadeos_NPC=Did that thing… mimic me?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_4_Player_Nosy=Like a Sorak, only faster, it would seem.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_5_Player_Authority=When did you last see Vigdis?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_6_Thadeos_NPC=Just after she came back from the Einareum!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_7_Thadeos_NPC=I had the difficult task to prepare my lord's body for the funeral…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_8_Thadeos_NPC=…but then I saw Ragnhild close to the casket…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_9_Thadeos_NPC=…I asked her what she was doing…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_10_Thadeos_NPC=…and she… cast a spell on me, or something.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_11_Player_Nosy=Ragnhild, the cousin?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_12_Player_Authority=We have our prime suspect. Let's move.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_13_Thadeos_NPC=Wait! What about me?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_14_Player_Authority=Go to Lady Vigdis' room. We'll meet you there.
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_1_Heddlon_NPC=Clear skies, Heroes of the Rift.
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_2_Player_Spy=You…Heddlon?
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_3_Heddlon_NPC=Shhh… I'm undercover. You can call me Silk.
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_4_Player_Authority=Spying on the Snow Alliance?
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_5_Heddlon_NPC=Just looking for something.
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_6_Heddlon_NPC=A scepter. It would be quite big, clearly Manacalon in design, and I would pay quite a bit for it.
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_7_Heddlon_NPC=If you're going north to find what is causing troubles, I believe you'll stumble upon it.
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_8_Player_Authority=What's in it for us?
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_9_Heddlon_NPC=As usual, a reward of great value.
Narration/&DLC3_HeddlonStart_10_Heddlon_NPC=Stay in the light, then.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_1a_Snorri_NPC=Marduk!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_2a_Marduk_NPC=Snorri!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_3a_Snorri_NPC=You must flee! They're not far!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_4a_Marduk_NPC=I'm not gonna leave you!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_5_Snorri_NPC=It's too late for me, but I left my family behind to lure the giants away from them.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_6a_Marduk_NPC=You have my word. Now let us help you!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_7_Snorri_NPC=I am beyond help, just save my kin and pray for my soul.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_8a_AnyClericOrDwarf_Normal=May you join Maraike in peace.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_1b_Snorri_NPC=Who are you?
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_2b_AnyClericOrDwarf_Normal=Friends of Pohjolen.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_3b_Snorri_NPC=The giants, they are after Marduk, our lord.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_4b_AnyClericOrDwarf_Normal=Don't worry about him, just hold on.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_DyingTrapper_6b_AnyClericOrDwarf_Normal=You have my word. Now let us help you!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Giants_1_AnyDwarforAny_Normal=Giants? Fighting each other?
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Giants_4_Marduk_NPC=Storm giants used to be friendly. Let's help them!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Giants_5_IfNoChiefButHistory10Success_Normal=Storm giants have a reputation for fairness.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Giants_6_IfNoChiefButHistory10Failure_Normal=I don't like this.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_1_Hjalmar_NPC=Thank you for your help…
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_2_Hjalmar_NPC=Marduk, Strongheart.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_3_Marduk_NPC=You look familiar!
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_4_Hjalmar_NPC=I am Hjalmar, son of Hjalmar, your people have a pact with my father.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_5_Player_Any=A pact the giants broke…
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_6_Hjalmar_NPC=A new warchief did it, Björni Blackcloud.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_7_Player_Any=Your father…
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_8_Hjalmar_NPC=Killed by Björni in a duel… but he cheated.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_9_Hjalmar_NPC=He used some artifact that made him stronger.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_10_Player_Any=It's time someone shows this Björni that he can't attack the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_11_Hjalmar_NPC=Without him, I can regain control of the giants, make peace.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_12_Hjalmar_NPC=Especially with… the artifact.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_13_Hjalmar_NPC=In exchange, I have gems for resurrecting people.
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_14_NOAUDIO=<i>Kill the giant</i>
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_16_Player=Who are you?
Narration/&DLC3_Giants_15_Player=We don't like your kind!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_1_Player_Authority=A done deed! Björni has met his fate!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_2_Player_Paladin=He was a demon, another one!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_11_Marduk=Demons! They're the ones who manipulated this giant to murder us!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_12_Player=They're as bad as the Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_13_Player=They use treachery, lies, and bribery… like with this artifact…
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_3_Player_Greed=And this is the artifact…
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_4_Player_Paladin=…It doesn't look demonic, rather Manacalon.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_5_Player_Greed=Silk will be happy.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_6_Marduk_NPC=Wait, we should give it to Hjalmar to help him regain control of the other giants.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_14_Marduk=Even with Björni gone, this war has hurt our relationship with the other giants…
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_15_Marduk=…this artifact could help us seal the peace, it's a symbol.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_added_16_Marduk=Anyway, it's up to you. I need to take Björni's head and show it around…
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_added_17_Marduk=…spread the word that the Pohjolen will return.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_added_18_Player=So you're not coming back with us?
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_added_19_Marduk=No need, just tell my son and my people that they can return home.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_added_20_Marduk=I will answer the call when the time comes to elect the Speaker for the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_added_21_Player=As you wish, Marduk. We'll see you then.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Give it to Hjalmar
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_8_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Give it to Silk
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_9_Player_Loyal=It's the right thing to do. The people of Pohjolen need all the help they can get.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_SavingTheDay_10_Player_Greed=We saved Pohjolen already. We'll give it to Silk.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_1a_Rolf_NPC=Did you meet my father in the north?
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_1b_Rolf_NPC=You were with him in his last moments! Tell me!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_2a_AnyDwarfOrHighCharism_Normal=We found his remains.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_3a_Rolf_NPC=He went alone, he died alone!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_4a_AnyDwarfOrHighCharism_Normal=Yes, we were too late.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_5a_Rolf_NPC=I shall remember your role in this!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_6a_Rolf_NPC=We shall meet again for the Speaker election!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_2b_AnyDwarfOrHighCharism_Normal=He died, like he lived!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_3b_AnyDwarfOrHighCharism_Normal=Fighting for his people!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_4b_Rolf_NPC=And the threat is gone?
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_5b_AnyDwarfOrHighCharism_Normal=Yes, thanks to his courage!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_6b_Rolf_NPC=You have my thanks! I shall remember your bravery as well!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_QuestWithoutMarduk_7b_Rolf_NPC=We shall meet again for the Speaker election!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_BanterSilk_2_Silk_NPC=Marvelous! And as promised, for you!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_BanterSilk_4_Silk_NPC=It's always a pleasure to do business with you.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_BanterSilk_5_Any_Normal=We still don't like your Empire very much, you know?
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_BanterSilk_6_Silk_NPC=But you like me, that's all that matters.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_BanterHjaklar_1_Any_Normal=Hjalmar, here's the artifact you wanted.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_BanterHjaklar_2_Hjalmar=Aaah, you have proved true allies of the giants!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_BanterHjaklar_3_Hjalmar=We shall not forget! And I shall call you friends from now on!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_BanterHjaklar_4_Hjalmar=As promised, gems for your resurrection spells!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_1_Player_Authority=Well, Lady Vigdis, I think the case is solved.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_2_Vigdis_NPC=Yes, but we still don't know why the Soraks are working with demons, or even how.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_2b_Vigdis_NPC=It will be our next goal to discover it. And about that…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_3_Player_Nosy=…do you know anything about the safe box for the Claw amulet?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_4_Player_Nosy=It is clearly a Manacalon item, not dwarven.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_5_Vigdis_NPC=I noticed. Moreover, it bears a sigil I've seen before.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_5b_Vigdis_NPC=It's related to a wizard. I think her name was Exonaïka.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_5c_Player=A Manacalon wizard in the middle of a pact made with dragon claws, with Snow Alliance dwarves?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_5d_Player=Don't forget the demons.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_5e_Player=We are in way over our heads. We just came here to chase Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_5f_Player=We are in need of a knowledge that is beyond our reach.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_6_Vigdis_NPC=I took the liberty to contact someone who knows a lot about the history of the Manacalon Empire.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_7_Vigdis_NPC=I could have sent you to Gorm the Wise but… Violet is a friend.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_8_Player_Nosy=So, this Violet is in the city?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_9_Vigdis_NPC=I'll have to tell you a secret. Can you keep it?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_10_Player_Cynical=Can't promise anything for these guys, but I can.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_11_Vigdis_NPC=Good enough for me.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_12_Vigdis_NPC=We have a Major Gate in the Keep.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_13_Player_Authority=By the gods!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_14_Vigdis_NPC=Violet has one too. Here are the passwords for both.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_15_Vigdis_NPC=May Einar guide you.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_16_Player_Friendly=We'll see each other again, Lady Vigdis, I'm sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Ending_17_Player_Nosy=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ToNecropolis_1_Misouk_NPC=Here, the wall is hiding a secret door.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ToNecropolis_2_Player_Dwarf=Classic defensive architecture.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ToNecropolis_3_Player_Friendly=Shhhh, don't disturb their mourning.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FindingTemple_1_Vigdis_NPC=What's going on here?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FindingTemple_2_Player_Paladin=A temple of Arivad, allies of the Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FindingTemple_3_Vigdis_NPC=What? Here, under my city?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FindingTemple_4_Player_Authority=They have been planning this for a while.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FindingTemple_5_Vigdis_NPC=Ragnhild…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FindingTemple_6_Player_Paladin=She's one of them, devoted to Sorr-Tarr.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FindingTemple_7_Vigdis_NPC=Take her!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_1_Ragnhild_NPC=You should have killed me!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_2_Vigdis_NPC=Why, Ragnhild, why?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_3_Ragnhild_NPC=You can't see the truth, my dear cousin. You and your light are doomed!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_4_Player_Friendly=It's useless, she's…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_5_Ragnhild_NPC=You! You think you've won, that my Lord Sorr-Tarr is barred from this world?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_6_Player_Paladin=Do you believe otherwise?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_7_Ragnhild_NPC=You'll see.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_8_Vigdis_NPC=Enough!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_9_Misouk_NPC=My Lady, she betrayed you and the clan, she deserves to die.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_10_Vigdis_NPC=Did you participate in any way in the murder of my father, your lord, Kaikonnen Vartija?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_11_Ragnhild_NPC=What do you think?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_12_Ragnhild_NPC=I wish I had plunged the blade into his heart myself.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_13_Vigdis_NPC=Anger would push me to sentence you to death, Ragnhild.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_14_Vigdis_NPC=But I'm a holder of the Shield, a light in the shadows, not a murderer.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_15_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=You should listen to Misouk.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_16_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Sentence her to life in jail.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_17_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Send her to jail for fifty years.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_18_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Pardon her.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_19_Player_ChoiceA=Misouk is right, she needs to die.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_20_Vigdis_ChoiceA=She's family.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_21_Player_ChoiceA=Your choice.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_22_Vigdis_ChoiceA=I shall follow your advice… though it pains me to do so.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_23_Player_ChoiceB=She must never walk free again.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_24_Vigdis_ChoiceB=A terrible punishment, but probably deserved.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_25_Player_ChoiceC=Send her to jail for a long time, for a dwarf, maybe a good fifty years.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_26_Vigdis_ChoiceC=That shall be a lesson she won't forget. Good idea.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_27_Player_ChoiceD=You should pardon her, she's been manipulated.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_28_Vigdis_ChoiceD=Did you hear what she said about my father?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_29_Player_ChoiceD=No, I'll never forgive her.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_30_Vigdis_NPC=Misouk, take her to the brig.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FoundThadeos_31_Vigdis_NPC=I need to report to Kaikonnen Hall, I'll see you later in my quarters.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_1_Vigdis_NPC=Do you have it?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_2_Misouk_NPC=Here it is.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_3_Vigdis_NPC=Oh, thank Einar, you're saving me.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_4_Misouk_NPC=Keep it close, my lady.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_5_Vigdis_NPC=What's wrong?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_6_Player_Authority=There were Soraks in the necropolis, probably after it.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_7_Vigdis_NPC=Gods… well, I need to go back.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_8_Player_Authority=We'll find out what happened.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_9_Vigdis_NPC=Thank you.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_10_Player_Selfpres=Where do we start? Everybody is a suspect!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_11_Misouk_NPC=I have… let's call it a hunch.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_12_Misouk_NPC=Thadeos.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_13_Player_Cynical=The grumpy butler? Really?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_14_Misouk_NPC=Something was off during the ceremony's preparations…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_15_Misouk_NPC=I looked for him, he wasn't around, that's unlike him.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_16_Player_Authority=That is pretty thin.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_17_Player_Selfpres=Let's ask around, someone may have seen him.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_ReturnAmulet_18_Misouk_NPC=I'll come with you, I know who to interrogate.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Lava_2_Survivor_NPC=Take these blueprints… they will help you restore the lava flow.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_SoraksSoldier_Well=The well must have collapsed on them.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_Soraks_Seal2=A dead Sorak? Beware…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_Puzzle_Hint_01=We should find answers in the document that the guard gave us.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_Puzzle_Hint_02=Let's all try to get on the slabs and turn the mechanisms in the right direction.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara1_Kara_NPC=Clear skies, Heroes of the Rift!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara2_Player_Highclass=My, my! Are we that recognizable?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara3_Kara_NPC=Well, no, but Stig sent word that you were coming.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara4_Player_Highclass=So it's not my good looks, what a disappointment.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara5_Player_Cynical=You'll survive.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara6_Kara_NPC=I am Kara Wisehead, priestess of Pakri and regent of Keskainen.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara7_Player_Pragmatic=You're in charge of the election, right? So how is it going?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara8_Kara_NPC=To sum it up, it's not.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara9_Player_Pragmatic=What?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara10_Kara_NPC=We have too many problems, the place is real mess.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara11_Kara_NPC=Disappearances, bandits, blocked tunnel…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara12_Kara_NPC=No way I can organize an election now.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara13_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Disappearances?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara14_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Bandits?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara15_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Blocked tunnel?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara16_Player_ChoiceA=People disappeared?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara17_Kara_ChoiceA=Yes, mostly workers from the Lower City.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara18_Player_ChoiceA=Soraks?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara19_Kara_ChoiceA=You tell me.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara20_Player_ChoiceA=Unmasking them seems to have become a specialty of ours.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara21_Kara_ChoiceA=I know, and I'm glad the Einareum sent you!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara22_Player_ChoiceB=How do bandits enter such a city?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara23_Kara_ChoiceB=Maybe they're some of us, preying on their own.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara24_Player_ChoiceB=Well, we've had some scuffles with bandits in our time.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara25_Player_ChoiceB=Shouldn't be too hard for us to help with that.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara26_Kara_ChoiceB=May Pakri hear you.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara27_Player_ChoiceC=What about the tunnel?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara28_Kara_ChoiceC=We use it for carts and merchants, but it's blocked, full of ice.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara29_Player_ChoiceC=Ice must not be new to you in this place.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara30_Kara_ChoiceC=Of course, we have a lava duct network to keep it clear.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara31_Kara_ChoiceC=But somehow, it's stopped working.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara32_Player_Highclass=Well, Mistress Wisehead, the place is, indeed, a real mess.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara33_Kara_NPC=Told you. Any help would be more than welcome.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara34_Player_Pragmatic=Any clues to start with?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara35_Kara_NPC=Before your go down to investigate the inner city, I'd like you to meet our candidates.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara36_Kara_NPC=Lord Steelheart of House Perlevinn and Lord Boldhand of House Ettiven.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara37_Kara_NPC=We're supposed to have a third, but he never showed up.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara37b_Kara_NPC=Once you've met them, I'll ask the guards to raise the elevator for you.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara38_Player_Highclass=Great. It's been a pleasure.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara39_Kara_NPC=Likewise.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetKara40_Kara_NPC=May the owl watch over you.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_DestructibleCover=What is this? It looks unstable.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_TunnelMeltStart=It's starting to melt! A few more hours to go.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_TunnelMeltDone=The ice has melted! This lava heat generator is really powerful!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_HeatGeneratorActivated=That should be good for the heat generator. Let's find a way out of this.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi1_Valdi_NPC=Clear skies, Heroes of the Rift.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi2_Valdi_NPC=I am Valdi Boldhand, Lord of House Ettiven.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi3_Player_Authority=We heard about your troubles.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi4_Valdi_NPC=Yes, yes, Kara must have told you.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi5_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=About the missing people.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=About the bandits.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=About the tunnel.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi8_Player_ChoiceA=What do you know about the disappearances?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi9_Valdi_ChoiceA=The mine workers complain about it all the time, but they always complain.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi10_Player_ChoiceA=Any idea who or… what causes them?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi11_Valdi_ChoiceA=Digging so deep, we sometimes anger elementals, but…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi12_Valdi_ChoiceA=…I would gladly send soldiers, if they weren't all on the Gallivan border.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi13_Valdi_ChoiceA=You may not know, but we're the only house sending axes and shields to defend the Snow Alliance territory.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi14_Player_ChoiceA=I'm sure the Alliance is glad.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi15_Valdi_ChoiceA=Pfeh.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi16_Player_ChoiceB=Do you know anything about those bandits?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi17_Valdi_ChoiceB=No I don't.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi18_Valdi_ChoiceB=They're probably just miners who chose to steal over honest work.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi19_Player_ChoiceC=How do you explain the tunnel full of ice?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi20_Valdi_ChoiceC=All I know is that the polls are in our favor.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi21_Valdi_ChoiceC=And now electors cannot enter the city. Ring a bell?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi22_Player_Authority=Thank you for your time. We really need the election to move forward.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi23_Player_Authority=We're gonna look into this.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetValdi24_Valdi_NPC=Fine with me.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir1_Brodir_NPC=Ah, here they are. You wanted to see me?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir2_Player_Authority=Yes, Lord Steelheart, thank you for granting us an audience.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir3_Brodir_NPC=As head of my house, you may address me as Perlevinn!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir4_Player_Sellsword=Sir!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir5_Player_Any=As you wish, Perlevinn.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir6_Brodir_NPC=An acceptable address.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir7_Brodir_NPC=Sir would also do, as I am in command of the forces of the house.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir8_Brodir_NPC=Mistress Wisehead informed me of your visit.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir9_Brodir_NPC=Though I doubt it is your place to mingle in the affairs of the Keskainen Clan.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir10_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=The Pact of the Claw
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir11_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=The tunnel
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir12_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=The bandits
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir13_Player_ChoiceA=We just need a Speaker for the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir14_Brodir_ChoiceA=Which means you must proceed with the election for head of the Keskainen Clan.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir15_Brodir_ChoiceA=Even more inappropriate, the Pact is none of your business.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir15b_Brodir_ChoiceA=Our traditions are none of your business, even one as pointless as the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir16_Player_ChoiceB=Any idea why the tunnel is closed, despite the lava ducts?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir17_Brodir_ChoiceB=No, I sent soldiers to investigate. They never came back.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir18_Player_ChoiceB=That's it? You're not looking for them?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir19_Brodir_ChoiceB=I can't spare more troops right now.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir20_Brodir_NPC=Our lava network worked for hundreds of years, it's fine.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir21_Player_NPC=We heard about bandit activity.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir22_Brodir_NPC=Bandits are not a problem if you know how to fight.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir23_Player_NPC=Maybe they're causing the problem with the lava flow.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir24_Brodir_NPC=Pff, our technology is clearly above your comprehension.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir25_Player_NPC=Well, we're going to take a look at this network.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir26_Brodir_NPC=Sure, if you're not afraid of bandits, eh.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_MeetBrodir28_Brodir_NPC=You know the way out.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Cynical29_Player_Cynical=You may address me as Lord of Assholes.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Cynical30_Player_Authority=Shut up.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_1_CaptainAshdown_NPC=This is it.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_2_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Our objective is to capture or kill an enemy general who is hiding in the castle.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_3_CaptainAshdown_NPC=But first we need to take control of the surrounding area.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_4_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Fortunately, my little friends can come to help.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_5_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Find a tree stump on the field, maybe even inside the fort, and hammer them with this.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_6_Player_Curious=A wand? What does it do?
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_7_CaptainAshdown_NPC=It will summon a couple of bulettes and they will fight for you.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_8_Player_Cynical=That's fun.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_9_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Once you open the castle's main gate, we'll launch the full assault.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_10_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Use force or stealth, as you see fit.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_11_CaptainAshdown_NPC=One more thing…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_12_CaptainAshdown_NPC=The traitor you caught had a document describing a secret passage in the walls.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_13_CaptainAshdown_NPC=You could use it to get right into the inner castle.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_14_CaptainAshdown_NPC=But then you'd be alone inside.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_CastleAssaultb_15_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Good luck.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_1_CaptainAshdown_NPC=That was incredible…
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_2_CaptainAshdown_NPC=…I'm glad you didn't turn against me!
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_3_Player_Authority=It was a difficult choice, we did it for a reason.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_4_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Yes, yes, I know.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_5_CaptainAshdown_NPC=This victory gives us a strong grip on the region.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_6_CaptainAshdown_NPC=I'll go to the clan house right away and get the amulet.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_7_CaptainAshdown_NPC=Summon me anytime for the election in White Rock City.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_8_CaptainAshdown_NPC=I will even vote for whomever you wish.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_9_Player_Authority=We didn't ask that much, but thanks.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_10_CaptainAshdown_NPC=The Snow Alliance thanks you, my friends.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_BattIeisWonb_11_Player_Authority=We'll see you in White Rock City then, Captain.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_TunnelBlocked_Player=Impressive, the tunnel is completely full of ice!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_ElevatorNotAvailable_Player=Unless you prefer to jump, the elevator is not yet available. Let's come back later.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_CollaspedGallery=Bad luck, the gallery collapsed.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_LavaWall_Exit=This is the exit we've been searching for!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_LavaWall_LavaFlows=The lava is slowly melting. Maybe if we restore every lava river and the heat generator?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_LavaWall_Observe=Solidified lava. It should melt once the river below is restored.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_LavaWall_DeadEnd=This tunnel leads nowhere. We need to find another way out.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_ChanceMeeting_1_Player_Any=Lisbath? Is that you?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_ChanceMeeting_2_Lisbath_NPC=Damn… can't say if seeing you is good news or the opposite.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_ChanceMeeting_3_Player_Any=What you are you doing here?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_ChanceMeeting_4_Lisbath_NPC=Getting my butt kicked trying to get reinforcements!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_ChanceMeeting_5_Player_Any=Reinforcements against what?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_ChanceMeeting_6_Lisbath_NPC=Monsters, they're about to overrun Goldentongue's caravan!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_ChanceMeeting_7_Player_Violent=Let's go crash the party!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_ChanceMeeting_8_Lisbath_NPC=Follow me!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_Guard_Elevator=Unless you have the authorization, you can't access Low City right now.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_CitizenBeast_Gilmar=Hey look, it's Gilmar!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Banter_CitizenQuarry_Gilmar=Glad to see you back, Gilmar!
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_1_Player_Any=What strange architecture.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_2_Player_Any=This is not dwarven craft… actually, it doesn't remind me of anything from this world.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_3_Player_Any=These markings, they're not magic runes, they're something else.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_4_Player_Any=Don't freak out, but this is Abyssal language.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_5_Player_Any=Maybe the Soraks made it.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_6_Player_Any=Well, I have a bad feeling about this…
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_7_Player_Any=Another of these weird pillars?
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_8_Player_Any=That can't be a coincidence.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_9_Player_Any=Just like the previous one, it's alien. It looks indestructible.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_10_Player_Any=And another one…
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_11_Player_Any=No surprise there.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_12_Player_Any=Do you think they're here for us?
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_13_Player_Any=Or rather, for each clan in the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_14_Player_Any=As expected…
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_15_Player_Any=It annoys me to still know nothing about these things.
Narration/&DLC3_InspectPillar_16_Player_Any=We'll find out eventually.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_1_Marduk_NPC=Ah, the Heroes of the Rift, perfect timing.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_2_Player_Authority=Lord Strongheart?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_3_Marduk_NPC=Einar sends you to me, I'm sure of it.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_4_Player_Nosy=We're here for the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_4b_Marduk_NPC=That thing with the Claw amulet?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_4c_Marduk_NPC=Who cares about that?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_5_Marduk_NPC=I say you're here to help me save my people.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_10_Marduk_NPC=Once this is done, I'll help you with your quest.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_11_Player_Authority=Since there's probably no other way… what do you need?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_12_Marduk_NPC=Some of my people stayed behind, I'm going to get them.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_12b_Marduk_NPC=To find the leader of the giants who attacked us.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_13b_Marduk_NPC=They used to be peaceful, I need to find out what caused them to go crazy.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_13_Marduk_NPC=
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_21_Player_NPC=Sounds dangerous. We need you in one piece.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_22_Marduk_NPC=Should I fall, my son is ready to step in as Pohjolen Vartmerkint.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_23_Marduk_NPC=And, as I would, he shall remember if you helped the clan or not!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ReadyToGo_01_Marduk_NPC=Are you ready? My axe is thirsting for giant blood.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ReadyToGo_02_Player=We still need to gear up.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ReadyToGo_03_Marduk_NPC=I'm getting impatient. Move your heroic bottoms!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ReadyToGo_04_Marduk_NPC=Fine, there is one place I need to check right away.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ReadyToGo_04b_Marduk_NPC=Fine, first I want to check the old aqueduct. An attack was reported there…
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ReadyToGo_04c_Marduk_NPC=…it may be a good place to start looking for those giants.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter8_Misouk=Ettilen turm-vill!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Banter9_Misouk=Maybe I wasn't clear enough about the looting part…
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_1_Player_Friendly=Oh, no… they got Marduk.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_2_Player_Authority=He was fearless, for sure.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_3_Player_Friendly=That's not good.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_4_Player_Pragmatic=Shall we pursue this quest without him?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_5_Player_Authority=Remember what he said… his son will step up and take the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_6_Player_Pragmatic=Not if we don't help his clan.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_7_Player_Authority=We have to get to the bottom of this.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_8_Marduk_NPC=They smelled the scent of blood.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_9_Marduk_NPC=Such an attack would never have happened before.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_10_Marduk_NPC=I need to check the hamlet where the caravans stop.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_10b_Marduk_NPC=I need to check the hamlet where the caravans stop.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_10c_Marduk_NPC=I hope they're alright.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_AfterAmbush_11_Player=Fine, but first we should cautiously look for tracks and identify the attackers.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Cousin_1_Ragnhild_NPC=So here you are.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Cousin_2_Ragnhild_NPC=I'm Ragnhild Bittercloud, Vigdis' cousin.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Cousin_3_Ragnhild_NPC=I hear you're going to investigate our lord's… demise?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Cousin_4_Ragnhild_NPC=Well, there's another house interested in leading the clan.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Cousin_5_Ragnhild_NPC=The Stonebeards.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Cousin_6_Player=Interesting… thank you for the tip.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Brother_1_Harld_NPC=Vigdis told me about you. You are heroes.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Brother_2_Harld_NPC=Thank you for honoring our father.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Brother_3_Player_Any=The honor is ours. Your father was a great chief.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Brother_4_Harld_NPC=I don't understand how they could get to him.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Brother_5_Harld_NPC=Maybe an inside job.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Brother_6_Player_Any=Don't accuse lightly, My Lord.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Brother_7_Harld_NPC=Of course… I hope you find whoever did this.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Brother_8_Player_Any=We'll do our best.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_1_Sander_NPC=Clear skies, friends.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_2_Sander_NPC=My name is Kaikonnen Sander. Vartija was my brother.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_3_Sander_NPC=Do you have a claim to the clan?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_4_Sander_NPC=No, no more than Vigdis.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_5_Sander_NPC=The lords of the great houses are going to decide.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_6_Sander_NPC=Vigdis is renowned. It should not be a problem.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_7_Sander_NPC=But?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_8_Sander_NPC=I heard about the attack. I fear Gallivan's assassins.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_9_Sander_NPC=Our attackers were Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Banter_Uncle_10_Sander_NPC=We all know who they work for, don't we?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Lokan_1_Lokan_NPC=What can this dwarf do for you?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Lokan_2_Player_Any=We'd like to know if you saw Thadeos early this morning.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Lokan_3_Lokan_NPC=Nope, haven't.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Lokan_4_Player_Any=Is it possible that he left town?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Lokan_5_Lokan_NPC=Not a chance. I would have seen him.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Lokan_6_Lokan_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Maja_1_Maja_NPC=Milords, how can I help you?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Maja_2_Maja_NPC=I think so, at dawn. I was starting the preparations for the wake.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Maja_3_Player_NPC=Did you see him go somewhere?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Maja_4_Maja_Any=No, after a while, he was just gone.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Maja_6_Maja_NPC=Of course.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Guard_1_KeepGuard_NPC=Guert Brownbottom, at your service.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Guard_2_KeepGuard_NPC=He went out at dawn, said he had preparations to make for the wake.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Guard_3_Player_NPC=Did he come back?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Guard_4_KeepGuard_Any=He did, shortly after, and remained since then.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Guard_5_Player_NPC=At ease, soldier.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Informant_1_Informant_NPC=My lady.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Informant_2_Misouk_NPC=Don't worry, they're friendlies.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Informant_3_Informant_NPC=Fine.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Informant_4_Misouk_NPC=Did you see Thadeos tonight, or early this morning?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Informant_5_Informant_NPC=He just made a trip to the mausoleum with a package, and returned without.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Informant_6_Informant_NPC=I have eyes on all exits. He's still inside.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Informant_7_Misouk_NPC=Good job.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Informant_8_Player_Any=Your…employee?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Informant_9_Misouk_NPC=One of them.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Merchant_1_Merchant_NPC=Well met!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Merchant_2_Merchant_NPC=Oh, mmm… I don't remember seeing him at all today, no…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Merchant_3_Merchant_NPC=…and I was here pretty early.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Merchant_4_Player_Any=Could he have crossed the gate without you noticing?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Merchant_5_Merchant_NPC=Well, I'm busy, but the guard would have seen him in that case.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Merchant_6_Merchant_NPC=You're welcome!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_MerchantHello_1_Merchant1_NPC=Welcome to my store!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_MerchantHello_2_Merchant2_NPC=Welcome to my humble shop.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_MerchantHello_3_Merchant3_NPC=Welcome, strangers!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_1_Player_Authority=Alright, let's talk about this for a minute.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_2_Player_Authority=Clearly, Thadeos went out to the mausoleum very early.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_3_Player_Nosy=Preparations for the ceremony, nothing strange about that.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_4_Misouk_NPC=But he came back to the Keep right away.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_5_Misouk_NPC=And I told you I looked for him. He wasn't around.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_6_Player_Any=Also, we're pretty sure he never left town.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_7_Player_Selfpres=So he was inside, but…?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_8_Misouk_NPC=There's another place you can go from the Keep.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_9_Misouk_NPC=The mines.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Investigate_Debrief_10_Player_Authority=Why don't we take a look, then?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_TellTheTruth_1_Vigdis_NPC=What's going on?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_TellTheTruth_2_Player_Authority=Your cousin Ragnhild, where is she?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_TellTheTruth_3_Vigdis_NPC=In her room, I suppose. Why?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_TellTheTruth_4_Misouk_NPC=She's the traitor, My Lady. I'm sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_TellTheTruth_5_Vigdis_NPC=No!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_TellTheTruth_6_Player_Authority=There's no time to lose. Let's go!
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter_Oak_1_NPC=The oak is already losing its leaves. This does not bode well…
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter_Oak_2_NPC=Last time, it was just before the War of Sorrow!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_1_Ravenna_NPC=Clear skies, adventurers!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_2_Ravenna_NPC=What can I do for you?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_3_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Shopping
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_4_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=What news?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_5_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Explain the scavengers
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Goodbye
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_7_Ravenna_ChoiceA=Sure!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_8_Player_ChoiceB=How's business?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_9_Ravenna_ChoiceA=Not bad, even so far from the Badlands…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_10_Ravenna_ChoiceA=…but between Gallivan and Soraks… clients are becoming scarce.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_Scavenger_14_Ravenna_ChoiceD=Strike true!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_SouthernRepresentativeTextBanter_01=I'm too busy right now, sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_SouthernRepresentativeTextBanter_02=Thank you for your help.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElvenRepresentativeTextBanter_01=I'm too busy right now, sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElvenRepresentativeTextBanter_02=Thank you for your help.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_HumanRepresentativeTextBanter_01=I'm too busy right now, sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_HumanRepresentativeTextBanter_02=Thank you for your help.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_UndermountainRepresentativeTextBanter_01=I'm too busy right now, sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_UndermountainRepresentativeTextBanter_02=Thank you for your help.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_KeepGuard_Banter_01=These are Lady Ragnhild's quarters.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_KeepGuard_Banter_02=I guard Lady Vigdis' room.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_KeepGuard_Banter_03=Welcome to Kaikonnen Keep.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_KeepGuard_Banter_04=These are Lord Harld's quarters.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaapunki_FleeingRagnhild_Player=Hey! Stop!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_Rhuad_Banter01=Did you find anything?
Narration/&DLC3_Violet_Banter01=Safe travels!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_MagicDoor1_Player_Any=Is that the magic door Rhuad told us about?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_MagicDoor2_Player_Any=If Violet couldn't open it…
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_MagicDoor3_Player_Any=Adrasteia's ring! It's shining!
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_MagicDoor4_Player_Any=What's the link between Adrasteia and this door?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_MagicDoor5_Player_Any=You know what? Let's go seek the answer to that question.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_1_Player_Authority=Clear skies, sir. Are you Gorm the Wise?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_2_Gorm_NPC=Ah, yes, the Heroes of the Rift!
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_3_Gorm_NPC=My eldest daughter had quite a few things to say about your… stubbornness.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_4_Player_Authority=Your daughter?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_5_Player_Nosy=You're Hertha Gormsdottir's father!
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_6_Gorm_NPC=Indeed, she represented the Antiquarians in the Legacy Council.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_7_Player_Cynical=Before she left.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_8_Gorm_NPC=Only to supervise our war effort, since the Alliance was drawn into the fray.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_9_Gorm_NPC=Anyway, Lady Kaikonnen told me what you're after.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_10_Gorm_NPC=Demons.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_11_Gorm_NPC=And yet you come from Master Goodcheer's laboratory.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_12_Player_History=We learned a lot about Exonaïka the Traveler.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_13_Gorm_NPC=The Manacalon master, yes… that's her specialty, not mine.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_14_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=The Pact of the Claw
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_15_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=The Speaker
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_16_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=White Rock City
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_17_Player_ChoiceA=What can you tell us about the Pact of the Claw?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_18_Gorm_ChoiceA=Since Lady Kaikonnen told me about it, I reopened a number of books…
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_19_Gorm_ChoiceA=…this Pact was sealed even before the Cataclysm…
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_20_Gorm_ChoiceA=…no wonder it has faded in our memories.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_21_Gorm_ChoiceA=I'm just starting to rediscover it. I need more time.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_22_Player_ChoiceB=What is the Speaker in the Pact of the Claw?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_23_Gorm_ChoiceB=It seems to be an honorary title…
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_24_Player_ChoiceB=Nothing about being a guardian of something?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_25_Gorm_ChoiceB=The original term for Speaker is old fashioned dwarven; it can be interpreted in various ways.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_26_Gorm_ChoiceB=Keeper, father, leader…
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_27_Gorm_ChoiceB=…although, despite the Claws being transmitted through the years…
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_28_Gorm_ChoiceB=…no Speaker has been chosen for hundreds of years.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_29_Gorm_ChoiceB=It would require the five clan chiefs to convene here and take a vote.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_27_Player_ChoiceC=Any advice on navigating White Rock City?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_28_Gorm_ChoiceC=You should just know that it's a time of unrest.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_29_Gorm_ChoiceC=Refugees from the north are flooding the gates.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_30_Player_ChoiceC=What's happening?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_31_Gorm_ChoiceC=I have no idea, they're fleeing something.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_32_Player_History=You've been a great help.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_33_Player_History=We believe that the Pact, Exonaïka, the demons are all linked.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_34_Gorm_NPC=And you worry about the Pact not having its Speaker?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_35_Player_History=You said the five clan chiefs need to choose one?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_36_Gorm_NPC=Yes. And it'll require the Heroes of the Rift to reunite these five individuals.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_37_Gorm_NPC=They're all bogged down in their own clan's problems. I haven't seen them here in years.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_37b_Player_Authority=Maybe, but if we are right, without a Speaker, their problems will become much worse.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_38_Player_Authority=Where can we find them?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_39_Gorm_NPC=I suggest you try to meet their representatives in this very city.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_40_Gorm_NPC=Then you'll see how hard your task will be.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_41_Player_Authority=Can we count on you to continue… reading your books?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm_42_Gorm_NPC=Of course, I'll send for you as soon as I find out more.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Caravan_1_Player_Any=What are looking for?
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Caravan_2_Marduk_NPC=Someone reported leaving a caravan here; they were besieged.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Caravan_3_Marduk_NPC=I want to track the culprits.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Caravan_4_Player_Any=By the gods!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Caravan_5_Marduk_NPC=Damn beasts!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Caravan_6_Player_Any=Let's stay low. We can take them by surprise.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_1_Player_Authority=Any news, Master Gorm?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_2_Gorm_NPC=With the help of Master Goodcheer, we clarified the threat that demons represent.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_3_Player_Nosy=We're all ears.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_4_Gorm_NPC=Exonaïka the Traveler accidentally reached the Demon Realms…
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_5_Gorm_NPC=…where she faced a very powerful being called Sessroth the Archreaver.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_6_Gorm_NPC=She retreated, but Sessroth followed her to Solasta using her own Gate.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_7_Gorm_NPC=Only with the help of her sister, Adrasteia the Prudent Shield, could she stop him.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_8_Player_Nosy=Sister?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_9_Player_Pragmatic=Explains how the ring opened Exonaïka's laboratory.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_10_Gorm_NPC=Together, the dragons built a protection to keep Sessroth out of Solasta.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_11_Gorm_NPC=He can travel from one plane to another, but cannot wander far from the Gate when on Solasta.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_12_Gorm_NPC=This protection is called the Palace of Ice, and if we got it right, it is in the far north.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_12b_Gorm_NPC=This protection is called the Palace of Ice, alas, we do not know where it is…
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_12c_Gorm_NPC=…the notes suggest it might not even be on this plane of existence.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_13_Player_Pragmatic=But we saw demons in the whole territory of the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_14_Gorm_NPC=I know. Somehow, the Palace has become… fallible.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_15_Player_Authority=So, does it have anything to do with the Pact of the Claw or not?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_16_Gorm_NPC=So far, it seems the Speaker is the guardian of the Palace of Ice.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_17_Player_Pragmatic=Well, it's pretty clear to me: no guardian, the demons escape.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_18_Player_Authority=This makes it even more urgent to elect a Speaker. We need to see the other clan chiefs.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_19_Gorm_NPC=That is probably the best course of action until we know more.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm2_20_Gorm_NPC=Until next time, my friends.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_1_Player_Friendly=Master Goodcheer!
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_2_Violet_NPC=Clear skies, my friends!
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_3_Gorm_NPC=We decided to compare our findings.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_4_Violet_NPC=It's been very useful.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_5_Player_Authority=Good. On our side, we have three clan chiefs ready to vote.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_6_Violet_NPC=About that, you'll need the five of them, yes, but not only.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_7_Player_Authority=Meaning what?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_8_Gorm_NPC=There is a precise ritual to link the Speaker to the Palace of Ice.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_9_Player_Authority=Not just a vote, then?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_10_Violet_NPC=We're looking into it, but it seems that it requires a particular item.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_11_Player_Cynical=Let's hope we can find it in a shop.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_12_Violet_NPC=It has a name, so it's probably a unique artifact.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_13_Gorm_NPC=I think it's the name of the Speaker.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_14_Violet_NPC=No, it's not, it's the name of the item.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_15_Gorm_NPC=I think I know my runes.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_16_Violet_NPC=This is Manacalon code, not dwarven runes.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_17_Player_Authority=We should probably give you a bit more time to study…
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_18_Gorm_NPC=The Guardian must gather the claws, it's a metaphor!
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_19_Violet_NPC=Dragons don't do poetry. We're talking about actual claws!
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm3_20_Player_Friendly=Let's go.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_1_Gorm_NPC=Ah, here they are!
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_2_Violet_NPC=Did you convince them?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_3_Player_Authority=We just need one more.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_4_Gorm_NPC=Well, you better hurry.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_5_Player_Nosy=What did you find?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_6_Gorm_NPC=We finally agreed that the Guardian is an item, a weapon of sorts.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_7_Violet_NPC=The Speaker is supposed to gather the amulets, the Claws, and assemble them with the Guardian.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_8_Player_Nosy=And?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_9_Gorm_NPC=The ritual works only because all clan chiefs agree to lend their Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_10_Gorm_NPC=This grants the Speaker the ability to power the Palace of Ice's walls…
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_11_Gorm_NPC=…channeling lifeforce through the Guardian.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_12_Player_Authority=Wait, the Speaker is drained by this ritual?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_13_Gorm_NPC=Nothing too hard for a dwarf lord, I suppose.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_14_Violet_NPC=The process is hardly harmful. No Speaker ever suffered from it.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_15_Player_Authority=Then what's the catch?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_16_Gorm_NPC=We still have no idea what the Guardian is.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_17_Player_Cynical=Didn't find it in a shop, then?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_18_Violet_NPC=And it seems the Palace of Ice needs a bit of lifeforce, it's fading.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_19_Player_Nosy=Hence the demons… leaking into our plane?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_20_Violet_NPC=Yes.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_21_Gorm_NPC=Fine, let's get our last voter, and hope that you'll find more in the meantime.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm4_22_Violet_NPC=Good luck!
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_1_Stig_NPC=Ah, the Heroes of the Rift.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_2_Stig_NPC=I am Stig Strongstone, herald of the Keskainen Vartmerkint.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_3_Player_History=The central guardians?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_4_Stig_NPC=Indeed, our home is Turvaamalinn, the Undermountain City.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_5_Player_Any=We'd like your clan's chief to come vote for the Speaker of the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_6_Stig_NPC=Oh, another election?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_7_Player_Any=What?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_8_Stig_NPC=Great houses are currently running to elect the clan chief.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_9_Player_Authority=You mean the clan doesn't have one?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_10_Player_Authority=How long will it take?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_11_Stig_NPC=No idea. The situation seems to be complicated.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_12_Player_Authority=We need to change that.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Valka_13_Stig_NPC=Fine, go to Turvaamalinn, speak to Kara Wisehead on my behalf.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm5_1_Player_Authority=It's done. The five clan chiefs will come.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm5_2_Gorm_NPC=Very good.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm5_3_Player_Any=What about the item, the Guardian?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm5_4_Violet_NPC=We have finally located it.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm5_5_Gorm_NPC=Somewhere in Turvaamalinn, in an ancient crypt of sorts.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm5_6_Player_Any=So we're going back there?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm5_7_Gorm_NPC=Chief Goldentongue will show you the way.
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm5_8_Player_Any=Oh, so he was elected?
Narration/&DLC3_Meeting_Gorm5_9_Gorm_NPC=Indeed.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_1_Player_Selfpres=It's… dead? For real?
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_2_Player_Paladin=And Sorr-Tarr?
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_3_Player_Logical=Just an avatar…
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_4_Player_Violent=Well, that felt pretty damn good, smashing his face.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_5_Player_Logical=Look, I think I found the soul of the Speaker!
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_6_Player_Paladin=A soul in a…ball?
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_7_Player_Selfpres=What's going on?
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_8_Player_Violent=The Gate, it has lost its power.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_9_Player_Logical=There must be a way to turn it on.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_10_Gatekeeper_NPC=Oh, yes, there is one.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_11_Player_Violent=Who spoke?
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_12_Gatekeeper_NPC=I am the Gatekeeper. You want to travel, I need a soul to power the Gate.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_13_Gatekeeper_NPC=In the Demon Realms, souls replace your mana.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_14_Player_Any=Don't even think about it!
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_15_Gatekeeper_NPC=Oh, you can also use yours. Of course, then you cannot travel.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_16_Gatekeeper_NPC=One of you stays, the others can leave.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_17_NOAUDIO=I'll stay.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_17_Player=I'll stay.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_18_Player_Any=You don't have to do this.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_19_Player_Any=Go, they're waiting for you.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_20_Player_Any=We'll come back for you, you know that?
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_21_Player_Any=I know you'll find a way.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_22_Player_Any=Stay in the light.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_23_Player=Let's use the Speaker's.
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_24_Player_Paladin=That's… no, we can't!
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_25_Player_Logical=We'll come back. We'll find a way.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_End_1_Player_Any=We found the traitor. You are free to work on the repairs!
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_End_2_Engineer_NPC=Great news, friend. Thank you for your help!
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_End_3_Player_Any=Don't forget: you owe us a drink.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_End_4_Engineer_NPC=Yeah, sure. See you at the tavern!
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_1_Player_Any=Are you the engineer who built the elevators?
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_2_Engineer_NPC=Ah, yes, my pride and joy.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_3_Player_Any=What happened to them?
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_4_Engineer_NPC=Sabotaged, I say.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_5_Player_Any=A grave accusation.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_6_Engineer_NPC=Someone here did it, I'm telling you.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_7_Engineer_NPC=I'd fix it but that bastard would destroy it all over again.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_8_Player_Any=What if we found that… person?
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_9_Engineer_NPC=Oh, then I'd owe you a lot.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_10_Engineer_NPC=Say, a beer. Each.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_1_YoungDwarf_NPC=Well, I've seen enough. Thanks for the adventure, my friends.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_2_YoungDwarf_NPC=I'm heading back home.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_3b_Player_Any=As you wish. Stay cautious, right?
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_4_YoungDwarf_NPC=I will!
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_Representative_1_Player_Any=We'd like to meet your clan's chief.
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_Representative_2_Kelariel_NPC=Elder Sharpmind is in the settlements, west of here.
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_Representative_3_Player_Any=Is there a Major Gate there?
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_Representative_4_Kelariel_NPC=Oh, certainly not. The Elder hates Manacalon magic.
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_Representative_5_Kelariel_NPC=Stay in the light.
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_Representative_1_Rivers_NPC=General Blunt is on the front. You know there is a war, don't you?
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_Representative_2_Rivers_NPC=There's a good road, then it's mud and blood far east.
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_Representative_3_Rivers_NPC=I'm afraid there's no other way.
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_Representative_4_Rivers_NPC=Stay in the light.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_1_WCInnKeeper_NPC=Welcome to my humble inn, Heroes of the Rift!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_2_Player_Authority=You don't have to shout.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_3_WCInnKeeper_NPC=I want everyone to hear… you know… marketing.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_4_Player_Cynical=How about a room for your guests of honor?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_5_WCInnKeeper_NPC=Ah, you want a discount, right?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_6_WCInnKeeper_NPC=You must be filthy rich, though.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_7_WCInnKeeper_NPC=Fine, you can stay for free, but don't tell anyone, okay?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_8_Player_Nosy=What news, innkeeper?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_9_WCInnKeeper_NPC=You can see the beggars in the streets are making my clients stay at home.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_10_Player_Nosy=They're fleeing death. They could do with some help.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_11_WCInnKeeper_NPC=I have kids to feed, too.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Inn_12_WCInnKeeper_NPC=Come back soon!
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperTooLate_1_Marduk_NPC=Snorri, no!
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperTooLate_2_Player_Friendly=Dead, massive blunt weapon.
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperTooLate_3_Player_Authority=Those who attacked the caravan have followed the trail here.
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperTooLate_4_Marduk_NPC=I knew him. His family is not there. They might have hidden somewhere nearby.
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperTooLate_5_Player_Authority=A whole family lived here. Where are the others?
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperTooLate_6_Player_Friendly=Hiding somewhere, hopefully.
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperTooLate_7_Player_Authority=Let's look for them.
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperTooLate_8_Player_Selfpres=Careful, I can hear growling.
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound1_Helga_NPC=Snorri, is that you?
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound2_Player_Medicine=She's delirious… fever.
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound3_Helga_NPC=Where is my husband?
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound4_Player_Authority=He couldn't come to your rescue, but we're here.
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound5_Marduk_NPC=Helga, it's me, Marduk. I'm sorry…
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound6_Player_Friendly=He didn't make it.
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound7_Helga_NPC=Nooo, my Snorri… I'm barely strong enough to carry my baby…
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound8_Player_Authority=You're pregnant?
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound9_Player_Medicine=She needs immediate care, or we might lose them both.
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound10_Player_Friendly=Tell me you have a spell or a scroll to save them.
Narration/&DLC3_FamilyFound11_Player_Medicine=She may not make it through the night.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_1_YoungDwarf_NPC=Hey, you're the Heroes of the Rift, right?
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_2_Player_Cynical=Guilty as charged.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_3_YoungDwarf_NPC=Can you take me with you?
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_4_Player_Authority=What do you mean?
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_5_YoungDwarf_NPC=I'd like to go on an adventure, but not alone, you see.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_6_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Too dangerous
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_7_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Why not?
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_8_Player_ChoiceA=You don't seem to realize how dangerous that is.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_9_Player_ChoiceA=You're too young to die.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_10_YoungDwarf_ChoiceA=Oh… fine, I understand.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_11_Player_ChoiceB=Well, if you're ready to risk your life…
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_12_Player_ChoiceB=…we weren't much more experienced when we started this.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_13_YoungDwarf_ChoiceB=Great! Thank you, I won't disappoint you!
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperFamilyDied_1_Player_Any=They're all dead… the tigers got them.
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperFamilyDied_2_Marduk_NPC=Helga… I'm so sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperFamilyDied_3_Player_Any=I see a column of smoke over there.
Narration/&DLC3_TrapperFamilyDied_4_Player_Any=Our murderers, maybe?
Narration/&DLC3_Traitor_Interrogation_2_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Your job.
Narration/&DLC3_Traitor_Interrogation_3_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=How long have you been here?
Narration/&DLC3_Traitor_Interrogation_4_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Anything suspicious?
Narration/&DLC3_Traitor_Interrogation_5_Player_ChoiceA=What's your name?
Narration/&DLC3_Traitor_Interrogation_6_Player_ChoiceB=What is your job, here?
Narration/&DLC3_Traitor_Interrogation_7_Player_Any=How long have you been doing this job here?
Narration/&DLC3_Traitor_Interrogation_8_Player_ChoiceD=Have you noticed anything suspicious recently?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Accuse_1_Player_Authority=You…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Accuse_2_NOAUDIO_ChoiceA=Intimidate
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Accuse_3_NOAUDIO_ChoiceB=Deceive
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Accuse_4_NOAUDIO_ChoiceC=Persuade
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Accuse_4_NOAUDIO_ChoiceD=Never mind
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Accuse_5_Player_ChoiceA=You're a traitor, admit it!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Accuse_6_Player_ChoiceB=We have proof that you're a traitor.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Accuse_7_Player_ChoiceC=Admit you're a traitor, and you might be pardoned.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Accuse_8_Player_ChoiceD=Never mind.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election1_Player_Authority=So, it's time. Who would make the best Speaker?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election2_Player_Selfpres=We're not going to decide, anyway.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election3_Player_Nosy=I think we have some leverage. They'll consider our opinion.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election4_Player_Any=Marduk is fierce, but he would not be very open to outsiders.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election5_Player_Any=Rolf is too young, scared by what happened to his father.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election6_Player_Any=Gilmar would be fine, maybe too interested in business.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election7_Player_Any=Vigdis would do great, she's fair, loyal, and just.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election8_Player_Any=General Blunt would kick them into shape.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election9_Player_Any=Captain Ashdown is strong, but we all know he could be a turncoat.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election10_Player_Any=Estorgath Sharpmind has unparalleled experience. That could be valuable.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election10b_Player_Any=We don't know much about Ael Brightheart…
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election11_Player_Authority=It's time for us to choose.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election12_NOAUDIO_Marduk=Marduk
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election13_NOAUDIO_Rolf=Rolf
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election14_NOAUDIO_Vigdis=Vigdis
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election15_NOAUDIO_Gilmar=Gilmar
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election16_NOAUDIO_Estorgath=Estorgath
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election17_NOAUDIO_Blunt=General Blunt
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election18_NOAUDIO_Ashdown=Captain Ashdown.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election19_NOAUDIO_Other=Other
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election20_Player_Any=Marduk
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election21_Player_Any=Rolf
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election22_Player_Any=Vigdis
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election23_Player_Any=Gilmar
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election24_Player_Any=Estorgath
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election25_Player_Any=General Blunt
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election26_Player_Any=Captain Ashdown.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB1_Gorm_NPC=Honorable guests, Vartmerkint!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB2_Gorm_NPC=The time has come to elect the Speaker for the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB3_Gorm_NPC=We recently rediscovered the real importance of this position.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB4_Gorm_NPC=The Speaker must ensure that demons can never invade Solasta.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB5_Gorm_NPC=All of you have faced this enemy, along with their allies, the Sorr-Akkath.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB6_Gorm_NPC=Which is why I know that you fully understand the responsibility.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB7_Gorm_NPC=Each of you has the right to be a candidate for Speaker.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB8_Gorm_NPC=If you do, raise your hand.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB9_Marduk_NPC=I stand for the Pact.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB10_Rolf_NPC=I stand for the Pact, but once this is over, Pohjolen will stay away in the north.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB11_Vigdis_NPC=I stand for the Pact, and I believe we should strengthen our ties with the Principality of Masgarth.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB12_Elder_NPC=I stand for the Pact, but I think the Alliance needs to enforce a strict equality…
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB13_Elder_NPC=…among its citizens of various lineages, and beware of foreign interference.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB14_Gilmar_NPC=I stand for the Pact, and I believe we must increase trade with our friendly neighbors.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB15_GeneralBlunt_NPC=I stand for the Pact, and will create a defense corps to muster our lines of defense on the borders.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB16_CaptainAshdown_NPC=I stand for the Pact, and I intend to make Gallivan pay for what they did.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB17_Gorm_NPC=I would like to ask our friends, the Heroes of the Rift…
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB18_Gorm_NPC=…to tell us who they think would be the fittest Speaker.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB19_Gorm_NPC=Even so, it's your right and yours only to name one of yours.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB20_Player_ChoiceA=We would favor Lord Marduk Strongheart.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB21_Player_ChoiceB=We would favor Lord Rolf Strongheart.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB22_Player_ChoiceC=We would favor lady Vigdis Kaikonnen.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB23_Player_ChoiceD=We would favor Master Gilmar Goldentongue.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB24_Player_ChoiceE=We would favor Elder Estorgath Sharpmind.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB24_Player_ChoiceF=We would favor Ael Brightheart.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB25_Player_ChoiceF=We would favor General Blunt.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB26_Player_ChoiceG=We would favor Captain Ashdown.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB27_Player_ChoiceH=Very well. Thank you for speaking your heart.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB28_Gorm_NPC=Now, let's proceed to the vote.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB29_Gorm_NPC=For Marduk Strongheart, raise your hand.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB30_Gorm_NPC=For Rolf Strongheart, raise your hand.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB31_Gorm_NPC=For Esma Blunt, raise your hand.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB32_Gorm_NPC=For Rassel Ashdown, raise your hand.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionB33_Gorm_NPC=For Gilmar Goldentongue, raise your hand.

Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionC_10_Gorm_NPC=How?

Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionC_12_Player_Authority=Even if we knew how, he faced two Manacalon master wizards and made them flee!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionC_13_Violet_NPC=I think you can enter there. As for the rest, it's up to you.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionC_14_Gorm_NPC=Only the Speaker has the power to visit the Palace.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionC_15_Violet_NPC=I think not. I think with the Guardian, anyone can.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionC_16_Violet_NPC=It's made of draconic essence and a bone…

Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionC_23_Violet_NPC=Not sure.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_ElectionC_24_Player_Authority=Fine, there is no time to lose. Otherwise, demons will invade Solasta.

Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_MeetRepresentative_5_Hergrunn_NPC=But the Alliance… well… looks to work only for the rich.

Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_MeetRepresentative_10_Hergrunn_NPC=He's the Pohjolen Vartmerkint. What do you expect?
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_MeetRepresentative_11_Hergrunn_NPC=But he has no army, he could use some help.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_MeetRepresentative_12_Hergrunn_NPC=I have seen Marduk grow up, and I know that his courage borders on the reckless…

Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_10_Player_Any=We killed a warmongering giant leader, Björni. He was working with demons.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_11_Player_Any=Your father was a hero, Rolf. You should be proud.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_12_Rolf_NPC=I am.

Narration/&DLC3_HelgaHealed_1_Helga_NPC=It's… a miracle.
Narration/&DLC3_HelgaHealed_2_Player_Medicine=You and the baby are safe from the fever now.
Narration/&DLC3_HelgaHealed_3_Player_Authority=But not from the monsters of the north.

Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_FirstRoom_1_Player_Any=It's like we're back on Solasta, but not.
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_FirstRoom_2_Player_Any=It's a demiplane just like in Telema.
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_FirstRoom_3_Player_Any=The pillars, they're doing this, like teeth planted in the very flesh of our world!
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_FirstRoom_4_Player_Any=I say we break those teeth, see how this damn Palace of Ice bites without them!
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_SeeingAllies_1_Player_Any=Hey, can you see us?
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_SeeingAllies_2_Player_Any=They're not really here, they're back home, in the real world.
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_SeeingAllies_3_Player_Any=But they fought with us.
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_SeeingAllies_4_Player_Any=Maybe the demons are in both planes, but not us.
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_SeeingAllies_5_Player_Any=How many of these pillars have we seen?
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_SeeingAllies_6_Player_Any=Four. That means three more to take down in addition to this one.
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_SeeingAllies_7_Player_Any=And three more battles?
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_SeeingAllies_8_Player_Any=At least. We need to be smart. There's no way to know when we'll have a chance to rest.
Narration/&DLC3_PalaceOfIce_SeeingAllies_9_Player_Any=In this place? I could never sleep.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_11_Engineer_NPC=Sorry, this elevator is out of order. Take the other one.
Narration/&DLC3_Elevator_Start_12_Engineer_NPC=We gonna fix it. We just need a little more time.

Narration/&DLC3_Telema_HectorsEntrance_02=Damn, we're not the first ones here?
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_HectorsEntrance_03=Look, up there. He didn't need to come through the door.
Narration/&DLC3_Telema_HectorsEntrance_04=Typically Sorak.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_Banter_Add01=Not sure which one is mine. I'll pick one at random.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroCS_01=War is raging in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroCS_02=The Sorak pawns in Gallivan have put their invasion plans on hold after the Battle of the Rift…
Narration/&DLC3_IntroCS_03=…and the victory of the four heroes who stopped the invasion of Solasta, all now peers of the Principality.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroCS_04=It is now of their own volition that the heroes decide to honor Marshal Sunblaze's invitation to visit the Einareum, the holy church that shelters the now inert Crown of the Magister.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election40_MakingTheGuardian=We will now proceed to the assembly of the Guardian.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Election41_MakingTheGuardian=Vartmerkint, gather around.

Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack3b_Player_NPC=No, they didn't have anything in common with Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack3c_Vigdis_NPC=They seemed to fight together!
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack3e_Player_NPC=Marshal Sunblaze was right to suspect something.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack3f_Vigdis_NPC=I'm sorry I brought you into this.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack3g_Player_NPC=Don't be. If Soraks are plotting in the Snow Alliance, then that's where we need to go.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_AfterAttack3h_Vigdis_NPC=Thank you.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis53_Vigdis_NPC=I have so many questions. I feel like I don't even know my own family's traditions.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis54_Player_Any=Maybe we're being too hard on you. You just lost your father.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis55_Vigdis_NPC=I have to be strong, especially with Soraks and… demons threatening my homeland.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis56_Vigdis_NPC=I'm glad you've come. I know it's not your country…
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis57_Player_Any=Masgarth is free of the Soraks. We have to chase them, wherever they are.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis58_Vigdis_NPC=You can count on me to help you.
Narration/&DLC3_Ambush_Meet_Vigdis59_Player_Any=Good to know. Now we should all get a good night's sleep.

Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis1_Vigdis_NPC=Clear skies, Heroes of the Rift.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis2_Player_Any=Lady Vigdis? Our condolences for your father.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis3_Vigdis_NPC=Thank you, I appreciate it.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis3b_Vigdis_NPC=It's hard, but he wouldn't want me to look weak.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis4_Vigdis_NPC=Also, Marshal Sunblaze insisted that I wait for you to return home.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis5_Vigdis_NPC=I hope it's not too much bother.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis6_Player_Any=We're after Soraks, and if they're scheming in the Snow Alliance, that's where we're headed.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis7_Vigdis_NPC=Of course, we need all the help we can get.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis8_Player_Any=We don't know much about your country. What can you tell us?
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis9_Vigdis_NPC=Well, it's cold…
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis10_Player_Any=Ah!
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis11_Vigdis_NPC=I hope you brought some warm clothes.

Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis14_NOAUDIO_NPC=Ask about history
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis15_Player_Any=I seem to remember that the Antiquarians are from the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis16_Player_Any=But what's the political stance of the country?
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis17_Vigdis_NPC=The Alliance is one of the three nations surrounding the Principality of Masgarth…
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis18_Vigdis_NPC=…we feared the New Empire might attack to take the Copperhead Road…
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis19_Vigdis_NPC=…but instead it was Gallivan. We owe that to the Soraks, I suppose.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis20_Vigdis_NPC=We would've supported you against the New Empire, but Gallivan…
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis21_Vigdis_NPC=…this war divided us. We were not ready for a threat on the eastern front…
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis22_Vigdis_NPC=…and yet, many of us still want to be friends with the Principality.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis23_Player_Any=Who's the leading figure in the Alliance?
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis24_Vigdis_NPC=Power is divided between the clans, and decisions are made in our parliament.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis25_Vigdis_NPC=There are a handful of great houses, families who generally lead the clans.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis26_Vigdis_NPC=My house, Kaikonnen, runs one of the five major clans, the Guardians of the South.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis27_Vigdis_NPC=Ettilen Vartmerkint, in dwarvish.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis28_Player_Any=Please don't ask me to repeat that.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis29_Vigdis_NPC=It gets worse: our capital city is Valkarokkopun, which means White Rock City.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis30_Player_Any=I think we'll stick to White City.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis31_Vigdis_NPC=That'll do.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis32_Player_Any=How was the Snow Alliance founded?
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis33_Vigdis_NPC=After humans arrived here, from the Rift.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis34_Vigdis_NPC=The Snow Dwarves were already providing shelter for sylvan elves…
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis35_Vigdis_NPC=…so it was decided to officialize an alliance…
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis36_Vigdis_NPC=…against the Manacalon Empire.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis37_Player_Any=So it's not just a nation of dwarves?
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis38_Vigdis_NPC=We are the most numerous, but no…
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis39_Vigdis_NPC=…there are human clans, and elven clans.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis40_Player_Any=Well, thank you for enlightening us, Lady Vigdis.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis41_Vigdis_NPC=You know, you don't have to call me Lady…
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis42_Vigdis_NPC=…you're heroes, I'm just a young cleric.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis43_Player_Any=Some of us believe in the idea of nobility, My Lady.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis44_Player_Any=But we can make an effort for you, Vigdis.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis45_Vigdis_NPC=I see. Don't let me disturb your group's… harmony.
Narration/&DLC3_Gardens_Vigdis46_Vigdis_NPC=I'll wait for you outside. Just tell me when you're ready to go.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis1_Vigdis_NPC=Oh, by the way, I asked about the Pact the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis2_Player_Any=Great. So what can you tell us about it?
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis3_Vigdis_NPC=It appears the Pact is the reason why the five main clans, the Vartmerkint, exist.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis4_Vigdis_NPC=It was sealed before the Cataclysm…
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis5_Vigdis_NPC=…which is why its origins were lost in time.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis6_Vigdis_NPC=But it used to be much more important than it is nowadays.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis7_Player_Curious=Anything about demons in that story, then?
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis8_Vigdis_NPC=No, but Vartmerkint means guardian…
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis9_Vigdis_NPC=…so it sounds like it was made to protect the land.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis10_Vigdis_NPC=…I hope to learn more after the wake…
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis11_Vigdis_NPC=…when I have more time to help you.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis12_Player_Friendly=It's fine. You should be with your family, it's important.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis13_Player_Pragmatic=We don't have much of a lead so far.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis14_Player_Selfpres=And yet, we still consider you a primary target for Soraks…
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis15_Player_Pragmatic=…which means we need to keep our eyes open.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis16_Vigdis_NPC=And I shall do the same.
Narration/&DLC3_BeforeWakeAdded_Vigdis17_Thadeos_NPC=My Lady, everyone's ready.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied1_Player_Any=Is he dead?
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied2_Player_Any=I'm afraid so.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied3_Player_Any=That spell was too much for him.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied4_Vigdis_NPC=Thadeos!
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied5_Player_Any=Vigdis… we're sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied6_Vigdis_NPC=Was it the Soraks?
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied7_Player_Any=A demon. Apparently, they can shapeshift in an instant.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied8_Vigdis_NPC=It's my fault, I should have noticed.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied9_Player_Any=Don't blame yourself.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied10_Vigdis_NPC=So that's it? This was their base of operations?
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied11_Player_Any=There's no trace of Soraks or cultists of Arivad.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied12_Vigdis_NPC=You mean it's not over?
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied13_Player_Any=We'll search the place for clues, but at this point…
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied14_Player_Any=…we still don't know what their plan was.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied15_Vigdis_NPC=I think I have an idea, although I don't much like it.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied16_Vigdis_NPC=I need to talk to someone.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied17_Player_Any=Alright, we'll clean up the place and meet you…
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied18_Vigdis_NPC=…I'll be in my room… and thank you.
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied19_Vigdis_NPC=Misouk… can you help me carry him?
Narration/&DLC3_ThadeosDied20_Misouk_NPC=Of course my Lady.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake1_Vigdis_NPC=Come in!
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake2_Vigdis_NPC=Did you find anything in that hideout?
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake3_Player_Any=No, nothing of interest.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake4_Vigdis_NPC=I've asked Maja to join us.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake5_Vigdis_NPC=She knows an ancient spell, one that's not taught in our temples…
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake6_Vigdis_NPC=…though I hear it used to be part of every cleric's prayer book back on Tirmar.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake7_Player_Arcana=Speak with dead…
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake8_Vigdis_NPC=You've heard of it?
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake9_Vigdis_NPC=Well, I figured if Thadeos knew something…
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake10_Player_Arcana=It's a grim process, but yes, considering the situation, it's worth a try.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake11_Vigdis_NPC=Maja?
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake12_Maja_NPC=I can do it. I just need some time to pray. I usually don't…
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake13_Maja_NPC=…have it prepared.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake14_Vigdis_NPC=Fine, I suggest we spend the night here, stay together.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake15_Vigdis_NPC=…we can share a meal and… well, I suppose that's a second funeral today.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake16_Player_Any=Won't your family find this strange?
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake17_Vigdis_NPC=They chose me as Vartmerkint. They'll have to live with my… weirdness.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake18_Player_Any=Alright!
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake19_Misouk_NPC=Are you suggesting that we all sleep here, in your room?
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake20_Vigdis_NPC=Come on, I did it a thousand times in the Badlands with people…
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake21_Vigdis_NPC=…much less respectable than the Heroes of the Rift.
Narration/&DLC3_AnotherWake22_Misouk_NPC=Fine, I don't wanna know.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead1_Vigdis_NPC=Well, Maja, are you ready?
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead2_Maja_NPC=I am, my Lady.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead3_Vigdis_Any=Let's do this.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead4_Maja_NPC=We can't ask too many questions, so chose them carefully.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead5_Maja_NPC=Start a question with his first name.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead6_NOAUDIO_A=Who killed you?
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead7_NOAUDIO_B=Who put you in a cell?
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead8_NOAUDIO_C=Who killed Lord Kaikonnen?
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead10_Player_A=Thadeos, who killed you?
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead11_Thadeos_A=I don't know.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead12_Player_B=Thadeos, who put you in a cell?
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead13_Thadeos_B=Ragnhild did.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead14_Player_C=Thadeos, who killed Lord Kaikonnen?
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead15_Vigdis_NPC=Ragnhild? No!
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead16_Vigdis_Any=Why would she do that?
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead17_Maja_NPC=Wait!
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead18_Thadeos_NPC=She tried to steal from my lord's casket, and I saw her.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead19_Maja_NPC=The amulet.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead20_Player_Arcana=She triggered the safeguard, that's why the amulet was teleported into the vault.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead21_Vigdis_NPC=What happened when you saw her?
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead22_Thadeos_NPC=A horned face, a spell, I don't remember.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead23_Maja_NPC=He's fading. He won't answer anymore.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead24_Player_Authority=We know enough.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead25_Vigdis_NPC=I can't believe it…
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead26_Player_Friendly=Maybe your cousin has been replaced too.
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead27_Vigdis_NPC=We need to arrest her, now!
Narration/&DLC3_SpeakWithDead28_PlayerCynical=Nice try…
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest1_Player_Authority=What will you do with her?
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest2_Vigdis_NPC=I don't know.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest3_Vigdis_NPC=I'm too upset to make a decision about this now.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest4_Vigdis_NPC=I could use a drink, or two.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest5_Vigdis_NPC=Would you join me at the inn?
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest7_Innkeeper_NPC=Lady Vigdis! It's an honor!
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest8_Vigdis_NPC=Please, I'm still the same dwarf as before.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest9_Innkeeper_NPC=Yeah, those were some memorable nights.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest10_Vigdis_NPC=Now you're going to embarrass me!
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest11_Innkeeper_NPC=Once, you were with that little fella…
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest12_Vigdis_NPC=Oh, Violet?
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest13_Innkeeper_NPC=Never seen someone that small drink that much!
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest14_Player_Friendly=So, you come to this place often?
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest15_Player_Cynical=I don't think we would have come across Princess Ceiwad in the Gravekeep's Cask.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest16_Vigdis_NPC=Welcome to the Snow Alliance.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest17_Vigdis_NPC=To think I used to come here with Ragnhild when we were young.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest18_Player_Authority=Misouk would have her executed…
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest19_Vigdis_NPC=…she's my blood.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest20_NOAUDIO_A=She should pay with her life.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest21_NOAUDIO_B=She must never walk free again.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest22_NOAUDIO_C=She's been manipulated
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest23_Player_A=I think Misouk is right.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest24_Player_A=She betrayed her lord, her family, and her clan.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest25_Player_A=If that doesn't deserve capital punishment, what does?
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest26_Vigdis_NPC=I hear you, but I grew up with her, it's not that simple.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest27_NOAUDIO_D=Still, she should be sentenced to death.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest28_NOAUDIO_E=It's your choice.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest29_Player_D=Your feelings should not stop you from doing what is right.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest30_Player_Cynical=Of course, you should do what you believe is right.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest31_Vigdis_NPC=I'd rather we talk about something else, if you don't mind.
Narration/&DLC3_AfterArrest32_Vigdis_NPC=She will be put on trial tomorrow. I have the night to think about it.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FindingTemple_3b_Vigdis_NPC=This was a mine during the Manacalon era!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_FindingTemple_3c_Vigdis_NPC=They've made it into a temple for their cult!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupa_Antiquarians_1_Player_Authority=Look, the flag of the Antiquarians!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupa_Antiquarians_2_Player_History=Of course, it's their headquarters.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupa_Antiquarians_3_Player_Cynical=Shall we knock and have a little chat about their pal, Halman Summer?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupa_Antiquarians_4_Player_Authority=I hear they went through a purge after his betrayal.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_4b_Misouk_NPC=This is bad, they're awfully dangerous!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_4c_Player_Arcana=Actually, it looks like they've developed new tactics…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_4d_Player_Arcana=…they're even more dangerous than before!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_4e_Misouk_NPC=An attack like this, up in town, it would be a slaughter!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Vault_Intro_4f_Player_Pragmatic=It's not their way. They infiltrate, corrupt, and replace key people.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Endingb1_Vigdis_NPC=Good morning, my friends!
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Endingb2_Player_Friendly=Good morning, Vigdis. How are you feeling?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Endingb3_Vigdis_NPC=Snow Dwarves don't get hangovers, if that's what you mean.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Endingb4_Vigdis_NPC=The headache is the trial. It's going to be this afternoon.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Endingb5_Player_Authority=At least the case is solved.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Endingb6_Player_Authority=Violet? The one who can hold her drink?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_Endingb7_Vigdis_NPC=That's just gossip, really. She's a very smart woman.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis1_Player_Friendly=Clear skies, Lady Vigdis!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis2_Vigdis_NPC=Clear skies!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis3_Vigdis_NPC=As you can see, I'm here. I need to meet the clans representatives.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis4_Player_Friendly=How did the trial go?
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis5_Vigdis_NPC=I followed your advice.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis6_Vigdis_NPC=But now… I regret it. I feel like something broke inside me.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis7_Vigdis_NPC=Let's hope someday Solasta will be clean of Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis8_Vigdis_NPC=Ragnhild won't see the light of day for a long time.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis9_Vigdis_NPC=Ragnhild will spend her life behind bars.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis10_Vigdis_NPC=I'll have to live with it.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis11_Player_Authority=It is the price you pay for being a clan chief.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis12_Vigdis_NPC=I know.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis13_Player_Arcana=We spoke with Gorm the Wise. We'll gather the clan chiefs to elect a Speaker of the Pact of the Claw.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis14_Vigdis_NPC=You know you can count on me. I'll be here.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis15_Player_Friendly=We do. Oh, we also had a great time with Violet.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis16_Vigdis_NPC=I'm not surprised. She knows how to entertain.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis17_Player_Friendly=We have to go. See you soon, Vigdis.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Vigdis18_Vigdis_NPC=May Einar guide you, my friends.
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumArrival1_Beric_NPC=But something came up that I have to take care of right away…
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumArrival2_Beric_NPC=…you've been traveling all day. You should take a rest. We'll talk tomorrow morning.
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumArrival3_Player_Any=Fine, where can we set up camp?
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumArrival4_Beric_NPC=Ah, you're pulling my leg, aren't you?
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumArrival5_Beric_NPC=We have a room set aside for you. Please make yourselves comfortable.
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumArrival6_Player_Any=Thank you, Marshal.
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumMorning1_Beric_NPC=Here you are!
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumMorning2_Player_Any=Marshal, it's a pleasure to see you again.
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumMorning3_Beric_NPC=Same wise, my friends.
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumMorning4_Beric_NPC=I called upon you, not as a member of the Legacy Council…
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumMorning5_Beric_NPC=…but as a keeper of the light in the face of darkness.
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumArrival6_Beric_NPC=I shall keep you informed of the political situation.
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumArrival7_Beric_NPC=Letters from the Einareum always find their destination.
Narration/&DLC3_EinareumArrival8_Beric_NPC=I would ask you to keep me updated of your progress in return, if you please.
Narration/&DLC3_LetterReceived1_Player_Any=We have a new letter from Beric Sunblaze.
Narration/&DLC3_LetterToSend1_Player_Any=We should write a letter to Marshal Sunblaze.
Narration/&DLC3_LetterToSend2_Player_Any=I'll do it.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Quarry_Skin_Banter_Player=What about that skin in the middle of the quarry?
Narration/&DLC3_Final_Decision_6b_Player_Paladin=That's… the soul of the Speaker! We found it!
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_1_Player_Slang=Morning, everyone!
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_2_Player_Formal=Good morning, my friends.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_3_Player_NPC=So, here we are, just a few more hours and we'll be able to sleep in a bed.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_4_Player_NPC=Well, the Einareum is basically a church, not a hostel.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_5_Player_NPC=I don't think Beric Sunblaze and his paladins sleep on the ground, though.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_6_Player_NPC=Come on, pack your stuff, let's not linger.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_7_Player_NPC=I still don't understand why we're not in Gallivan looking for what's left of the Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_8_Player_NPC=Marshal Sunblaze is obsessed with them…
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_9_Player_NPC=…I'm pretty sure he wants to tell us about them.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroWakeup_10_Player_NPC=We'll know what he wants soon enough.
Narration/&DLC3_GallivanBorder_MeetGeneral_Quest2_22b_GeneralBlunt_NPC=If we succeed, Glendale Castle will be vulnerable to a direct attack.
Narration/&DLC3_Weather_1_Player_Blizzard1=It's freezing!
Narration/&DLC3_Weather_2_Player_Blizzard1=What I wouldn't give for a nice fire!
Narration/&DLC3_Weather_3_Player_Blizzard1=It's so cold!
Narration/&DLC3_Weather_4_Player_Blizzard2=I can't feel my fingertips!
Narration/&DLC3_Weather_5_Player_Blizzard2=We're gonna freeze to death!
Narration/&DLC3_Weather_6_Player_Blizzard2=Warm clothes, she said!
Narration/&DLC3_Weather_7_Player_BlizzardStop=Gods, that feels so good!
Narration/&DLC3_Weather_8_Player_BlizzardStop=At last, it stopped snowing.
Narration/&DLC3_Weather_9_Player_BlizzardStop=I feel better already!
Narration/&DLC3_IntroPostAttack_1_Player_Any=I didn't expect an attack so close to the Einareum!
Narration/&DLC3_IntroPostAttack_2_Player_Any=They're in uniform, they're not bandits.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroPostAttack_3_Player_Any=Mercenaries from Gallivan!
Narration/&DLC3_IntroPostAttack_4_Player_Any=So deep into the Principality's territory!
Narration/&DLC3_IntroPostAttack_5_Player_Any=Don't be fooled. They didn't come to invade, they came for us.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroPostAttack_6_Player_Any=Let's move. We need to speak to Marshal Sunblaze.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_100_Player=Actually, some of their mercenaries attacked us on our way here.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_101_Beric=Really? That's another sign of their ties to the Soraks.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_102_Beric=You're targets, now.
Narration/&DLC3_Einareum_MeetingBeric_103_Player=Don't worry about us.
Narration/&DLC3_Warcries_1_ItainenSoldier1_Any=To arms!
Narration/&DLC3_Warcries_2_ItainenSoldier2_Any=Itainen!
Narration/&DLC3_Warcries_3_ItainenSoldier3_Any=For the Salamander!
Narration/&DLC3_Warcries_4_ItainenSoldier1_Any=There's too many of them!
Narration/&DLC3_Warcries_5_ItainenSoldier2_Any=Light the beacon!
Narration/&DLC3_Warcries_6_ItainenSoldier3_Any=Call for reinforcements! Light the beacon!
Narration/&DLC3_Warcries_7_CaptainAshdown_Any=We need to light the beacon!
Narration/&DLC3_Warcries_8_CaptainAshdown_Any=The beacon will call up reinforcements!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_24_Marduk_NPC=Now listen, I'm warning you, I'm leaving tomorrow…
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_MeetMarduk_25_Marduk_NPC=…so get a good night's sleep, and get your asses back here before it's too late!
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_6_Marduk_NPC=I still don't understand why you didn't give Hjalmar what he wanted.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_7_Marduk_NPC=Now I'll always wonder if he's not going to be the next Björni…
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_8_Marduk_NPC=…also…
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_9_Marduk_NPC=If we had followed my plan, maybe Snorri and Helga and the kids would still be alive.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_10_Marduk_NPC=You're good at killing monsters, I'll give you that.
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_11_Marduk_NPC=But you probably don't have many friends left alive…
Narration/&DLC3_NorthernClans_Ending_12_Marduk_NPC=So yes, I'll vote, but with my guts.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_20_KaraWise_Head_NPC=Therefore, I respectfully ask our honorable friends…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_21_KaraWise_Head_NPC=…the Heroes of the Rift…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_HighCityFinal_22_KaraWise_Head_NPC=…to leave us until the election is over.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_30_Player_Any=What happened to you?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_31_Gilmar_NPC=The Peak Terrors, they attacked just as we arrived!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_32_Gilmar_NPC=They caused an avalanche that washed away part of the bridge…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_33_Gilmar_NPC=…and many of our people.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_34_Gilmar_NPC=We tried to enter the city, but with the tunnel blocked…
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_35_Gilmar_NPC=…we had to take refuge here, and then the monsters found us.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_GilmarOutside_36_Player_Any=Well, you're safe now.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_AfterBattle_1_Player_Any=Everyone alright?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_AfterBattle_2_Player_Any=That felt like a trap.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_AfterBattle_3_Player_Any=The Guardian was simply… guarded.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_AfterBattle_4_Player_Any=I don't think so. Look at this opening, the dragon broke in and nested here.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_AfterBattle_5_Player_Any=At least we have what we came for.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_AfterBattle_6_Player_Any=Doesn't look like much.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_AfterBattle_7_Player_Any=Let's get back to Gilmar.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_1_Gilmar_NPC=Ah, do you have it?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_2_Player_Any=We do, but we ran into a bit of trouble at that old temple.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_3_Gilmar_NPC=Like what?
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_4_Player_Any=A white dragon, and a few of its friends.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_5_Gilmar_NPC=By the gods! You speak of it like if it was a routine encounter!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_6_Player_Any=Come to think of it, it certainly wasn't our first dragon.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_7_Gilmar_NPC=And you're humble, too!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_8_Player_Any=Here, your amulet, and thanks again.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_9_Gilmar_NPC=You are most welcome, my friends!
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_10_Player_Any=Now Gorm will be able to summon the chiefs for the election.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_11_Gilmar_NPC=I know, I'll be waiting for the call.
Narration/&DLC3_Undermountain_Return_End_12_Player_Any=We'll see you there, then.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_1_YoungDwarf_NPC=Hey, friends!
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_2_Player_Any=Isrid! How are you?
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_3_YoungDwarf_NPC=I'm great! I learned so much with you guys!
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_4_YoungDwarf_NPC=Someday I will write my name in the halls of the heroes of the Snow Alliance!
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_5_Player_Any=Sure, you've got talent, kid.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_6_Player_Any=Take it easy, kid.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_7_YoungDwarf_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_8_Mother_NPC=You! You're the ones who killed my baby!
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_9_Player_Any=What?
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_10_YoungDwarf_NPC=Isrid, you don't even remember her!
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_11_Player_NPC=We're so sorry. She was very brave, and old enough to make her own decisions.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_12_Mother_NPC=Going to fight giants? Really?
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_13_Mother_NPC=It's all your fault.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_14_Player_Any=You're right, but we can't change the past. It was a terrible mistake.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_15_Mother_NPC=Your excuses won't bring her back…
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_16_Player_Any=There's only one way to give meaning to her death.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_AliveOrDead_17_Player_Any=We need to continue to fight the enemies of Solasta.
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_14_YoungDwarf_ChoiceB=Oh, by the way, my name is Isrid Farsky!
Narration/&DLC3_YoungDwarf_15_YoungDwarf_ChoiceB=Alright, welcome to the club, Isrid!
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_FakeElderReveal_1_Elder_NPC=Ha! Ha! Ha! You fools!
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_FakeElderReveal_2_Elder_NPC=You're far too late!
Narration/&DLC3_Elven_FakeElderReveal_3_Elder_NPC=None of you mortals can stop the Archreaver!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_A_1_Player_Any=So, how do we proceed?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_A_2_Player_Any=This weapon Exonaïka made, it's got me thinking.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_A_3_Player_Any=The Sovereign?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_A_4_Player_Any=Yes. It allows us to use True Sight. What if it could reveal a shapeshifter?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_A_5_Player_Any=It's worth a try.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_B_1_Player_Any=Nondetection, you don't see that everyday…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_B_2_Player_Any=These guys have something to hide.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_B_3_Player_Any=Wanting privacy is not a crime.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_B_4_Player_Any=Anyway, I think we have our list of suspects. Let's talk to them.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_B_5_Player_Any=And be ready for anything.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_1_Brennen_NPC=Of course, it's an honor to meet heroes such as yourselves.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_2_Brennen_NPC=I'm Brennen Lingard.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_3_Player_Any=Well, Brennen, we believe there's a Sorak infiltrator here somewhere.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_4_Brennen_NPC=What? Here? In the fort?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_5_Brennen_NPC=That's ridiculous, the commander would have noticed!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_6_Player_Any=They are almost perfect shapeshifters and imitators.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_7_Brennen_NPC=There are things you can't fake.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_8_Player_Any=Care to elaborate?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_9_Brennen_NPC=Er… no.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_10_Player_Any=If you suspected someone in this garrison, who would that be?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_11_Brennen_NPC=What? No, I can't do that.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_12_Brennen_NPC=If he hears about this, he's going to hate me forever!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_13_Player_Any=So, it's a he?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_14_Brennen_NPC=What? No!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_15_Player_Any=Come on, you've already said too much.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_16_Brennen_NPC=Alright, fine… but it's just… the man's weird, that's all.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_17_Player_Any=Name?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_18_Brennen_NPC=Weyne Tayler… he acts strange sometimes…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_19_Brennen_NPC=…like he doesn't get how people work.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_20_Player_Any=Sorak infiltrators don't normally make that kind of basic mistake.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_21_Brennen_NPC=See? I'm bad at this.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_22_Player_Any=We'll come back to you.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_1_Tea_NPC=A'ten'hut!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_2_Player_Any=At ease, soldier…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_3_Tea_NPC=Corporal First Class Tea Horvan, at your service!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_4_Player_Any=Well, corporal…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_5_Player_Any=…we're looking for a Sorak infiltrator.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_6_Player_Any=Here, among your comrades.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_7_Tea_NPC=By all the gods, you suspect me?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_8_Player_Any=Everyone is a suspect.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_9_Tea_NPC=Really?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_10_Player_Any=Yes, you too.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_11_Tea_NPC=But I'm a loyal soldier of the Principality.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_12_Player_Any=Why would anyone say any different?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_13_Tea_NPC=My record's clean. Check with the commander.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_14_Player_Any=We will.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_15_Player_Any=You do seem awfully nervous, though.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_16_Tea_NPC=And why not? I've fought hard to make a career here!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_17_Tea_NPC=And now, this…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_18_Player_Any=Do you suspect anyone else?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_19_Tea_NPC=Well, sure, Lorna…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_20_Tea_NPC=…she's left her guard post at night more than once.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_21_Tea_NPC=I've caught her a couple of times, reported her.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_22_Tea_NPC=The commander doesn't seem to care.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_1_Lorna_NPC=Clear skies.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_2_Player_Any=What's your name, soldier?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_3_Lorna_NPC=Lorna Mighten.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_4_Lorna_NPC=Am I in trouble?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_5_Player_Any=Why would you be?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_6_Lorna_NPC=I don't know, but you're questioning people.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_7_Player_Any=We are.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_8_Player_Any=If there's anything you want to come clean about, now's the time.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_9_Lorna_NPC=I… I've nothing to say.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_10_Player_Any=We will find out eventually.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_11_Player_Any=Did you notice anything… strange recently?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_12_Lorna_NPC=Strange? Like what?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_13_Player_Any=Maybe one of your comrades behaving in a strange way?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_14_Lorna_NPC=Not that I can remember. No, I don't think so.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_15_Player_Any=You're not exactly helping.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_16_Lorna_NPC=You're not exactly being clear about what you're looking for.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_17_Player_Any=A Sorak infiltrator.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_18_Lorna_NPC=Blessed Maraike!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_19_Lorna_NPC=You think that's what I am?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_20_Player_Any=Possibly.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_21_Lorna_NPC=That's preposterous!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_22_Player_Any=So is it someone else?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_23_Lorna_NPC=We're done here.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_1_Weyne_NPC=Hey there.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_2_Player_Any=Clear skies, soldier.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_3_Weyne_NPC=I'm Weyne Tayler, crossbowman.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_4_Player_Any=We're investigating a possible Sorak infiltration.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_5_Weyne_NPC=Soraks? Here? That's a strange notion.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_6_Player_Any=You know they can shapeshift into anyone, mimic them?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_7_Weyne_NPC=I know what a Sorak is.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_8_Player_Any=So, you could be one of them.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_9_Weyne_NPC=I suppose so, but I'm not.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_10_Weyne_NPC=Is that really how you investigate people, just ask them if they're Soraks?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_11_Player_Any=That's only the beginning. We've unmasked a lot of them already.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_12_Weyne_NPC=Yeah, I've heard about the things you've done.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_13_Player_Any=You don't seem too impressed.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_14_Weyne_NPC=Sorry, that's just me. People say I'm a bit weird.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_15_Weyne_NPC=I'm just a simple farmer's son, not like all these rich people and city types.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_16_Player_Any=Do you resent them?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_17_Weyne_NPC=Sometimes.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_18_Weyne_NPC=They don't like me.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_19_Weyne_NPC=I'm sure if you ask them, they'll point their fingers at me.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_20_Player_Any=And if you had to say, who do you think would be the traitor?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_21_Weyne_NPC=Don't know… Lorna, she's a real bootlicker.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_22_Weyne_NPC=Brennen maybe, he's hiding something for sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_23_Weyne_NPC=Could be anyone, except the commander, of course.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_24_Player_Any=Understood. Thanks for your time.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_Debrief_1_Player_Any=Well, I don't know what to think.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_Debrief_2_Player_Any=We have some possible suspects. Let's go back and put some more pressure on them.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_Debrief_3_Player_Any=Do you think we have enough evidence to accuse anyone?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_Debrief_4_Player_Any=We should search the place. There might be some clues.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_Debrief_5_Player_Any=One of them is definitely a Sorak, let's not be shy about it.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_1_Player_Any=Alright, Brennen, spit it out.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_2_Brennen_NPC=What? I'm not a Sorak!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_3_Player_Any=You're definitely hiding something, we know that for sure!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_4_Brennen_NPC=But…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_5_Brennen_NPC=Fine, fine… but please don't tell the commander.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_6_Player_Any=Speak up, now!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_7_Brennen_NPC=It's, it's… look, I'm having an affair, okay!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_8_Player_Any=What?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_9_Brennen_NPC=With Lorna. We sneak off into the stables whenever one of us in on guard duty.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_10_Brennen_NPC=Honestly, we only leave our posts for a short time.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_11_Player_Any=A very, very short time, I'm sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_12_Brennen_NPC=I know Weyne suspects us…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_13_Player_Any=Alright, you're an embarrassment to your uniform, but you're probably not the one we're looking for.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_14_NOAUDIO_A=You're under arrest.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_15_NOAUDIO_B=We'll be coming back to you.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_16_Player_A=You're under arrest, drop your weapons!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_17_Player_B=This isn't over yet.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_18_Brennen_NPC=What? No! I'm innocent!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_19_Player_Any=Take off your nondetection device now.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_20_Brennen_NPC=What, my amulet? Is that why you suspect me?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_21_Brennen_NPC=Here, you can scrutinize me as much as you like!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_22_Player_Any=He's human.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_23_Brennen_NPC=Of course I am!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_24_Player_Any=Sorry…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_25_Brennen_NPC=Not as sorry as I am!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_26_Player_Any=Damn… Garrad's going to be mad.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_27_Player_Any=We can't do anything about that now.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_28_Player_Any=Another mistake?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectA_Return_29_Player_Any=We have to do better.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_1_Player_Any=Alright, Tea…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_2_Tea_NPC=What is it now?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_3_Player_Any=Why do you try so hard to please the commander?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_4_Tea_NPC=I want to be an officer!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_5_Tea_NPC=…is ambition a crime?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_6_Player_Any=Or you're trying to divert suspicion.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_7_Tea_NPC=Fine, if you're going to accuse me, do it.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_8_Tea_NPC=Let's be done with it.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_9_Tea_NPC=Kill me! They say Soraks return to their real form when they're dead.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_10_Tea_NPC=I dare you.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_11_NOAUDIO_A=Take off that nondetection device.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_12_NOAUDIO_B=We'll be back.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_13_Player_A=Somehow you're under a nondetection spell. We need you to remove it.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_14_Player_B=We're not done with you.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_15_Tea_NPC=Oh, you mean my amulet?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_16_Tea_NPC=That's what this is about?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_17_Tea_NPC=Be my guest, here, you can use your magic now.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_18_Player_Any=Human…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_19_Tea_NPC=Of course!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_20_Tea_NPC=You better go tell the commander that I'm clean, and I mean now.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectB_Return_21_Tea_NPC=I don't want my unblemished record stained by your incompetence!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_1_Player_Any=We need to talk.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_2_Lorna_NPC=Do I have a choice?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_3_Player_Any=No, not really.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_4_Player_Any=We hear you sometimes leave your post at night.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_5_Lorna_NPC=Who said that?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_6_Player_Any=Why do you need to know? Is it true?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_7_Lorna_NPC=I need my privacy. Men don't seem to understand that.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_8_Player_Any=Why is it that only you take more time than others?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_9_Player_Any=Come on, we've caught you out.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_10_Lorna_NPC=I'm sorry… I know, I'm weak…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_11_Lorna_NPC=It's so hard here, so lonely…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_12_Lorna_NPC=I know we're not allowed to fraternize…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_13_Lorna_NPC=But I couldn't help it…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_14_Player_Any=What?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_15_Lorna_NPC=It's Brennen, we see each other… at night when we're on duty.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_16_NOAUDIO_A=You're under arrest.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_17_NOAUDIO_B=Never mind.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_18_Player_A=That's it, you're under arrest.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_19_Player_B=You're off the hook, for now.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_20_Lorna_NPC=No please! I'm innocent.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_21_Player_Any=You wear a nondetection device. That's not helping your case!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_22_Lorna_NPC=Here, look, I'll take it off. Here, see, I'm human!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_23_Player_Any=She's telling the truth.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_24_Lorna_NPC=Thank the gods, yes, I'm not one of them!
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectC_Return_25_Player_Any=Fine, you're free to go.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_1_Weyne_NPC=Ah, so you're back.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_2_Player_Any=We are.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_3_Player_Any=We've pretty much exonerated everyone but you.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_4_Weyne_NPC=Oh.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_5_Player_Any=You wear a nondetection device, why?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_6_Weyne_NPC=Privacy?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_7_Player_Any=We need you to take it off.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_8_Weyne_NPC=No need.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_9_Player_Any=Why's that?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_10_Player_Any=We found a damning piece of paper, hidden in a crossbow.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_11_Weyne_NPC=You did?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_12_Player_Any=It was encrypted, but it doesn't help your case.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_13_Weyne_NPC=I gotta say, you're not very good at this.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_14_Weyne_NPC=You've accused just about everyone around here. That's pretty lame.
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_15_Weyne_NPC=And now you're accusing me because you've got no other suspects left?
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_16_Weyne_NPC=Well, it doesn't matter if my operation's been discovered…
Narration/&DLC3_Garrad_InvestigationV2_SuspectD_Return_17_Weyne_NPC=As long as I take your heads!
Narration/&DLC3_PreviouslyIn=Previously, in Crown of the Magister…
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_MisoukIntroductionToNPC=Hello, our guests here have a few questions for you.
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_MisoukIntroductionToNPC2=Hello, do you have a few minutes for our guests?
Narration/&DLC3_Kaupaa_MisoukIntroductionToNPC3=Hello, I need information for our guests here.
Narration/&DLC3_LetterFromBeric01=Hey, we have a new letter from Marshal Sunblaze.
Narration/&DLC3_LetterFromBeric02=It looks like we have a new message from Beric Sunblaze.
Narration/&DLC3_LetterFromBeric03=We should write back, give him some information about what we've discovered.
Narration/&DLC3_BreakDestructibles=We need to break these things.
Narration/&DLC3_BreakDestructibles2=We need to clear these. A good hit or two should do the job.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroCinematic_01=War is raging in the Eastern Kingdoms.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroCinematic_02=Yet the Sorak pawns in Gallivan have put their invasion plans on hold after the Battle of the Rift…
Narration/&DLC3_IntroCinematic_03=…and the victory of the four heroes who stopped the invasion of Solasta, now peers of the Principality.
Narration/&DLC3_IntroCinematic_04=It is of their own volition that they decide to honor Marshal Sunblaze's invitation to visit the Einareum, the holy church that now shelters the powerless Crown of the Magister.
Narration/&DLC3_OutroCinematic_01=Finally, the Soraks have lost.
Narration/&DLC3_OutroCinematic_02=They will not threaten Solasta again.
Narration/&DLC3_OutroCinematic_03=The Kingdom of Gallivan is restored, cleaned of corruption. It's a new era for the Eastern Kingdoms, led by the Principality of Masgarth, now a central power in the region.
Narration/&DLC3_OutroCinematic_04=Solasta remains a vast world of many countries and cultures, and so there is little doubt that other dangers will appear, requiring heroes who can meet the challenge.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_2_Darol_NPC=Eh, you'd be surprised how many people behave terribly despite the war.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_3_Player_Any=What do you mean?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_4_Darol_NPC=It's all gossip and petty betrayals, for money, or reputation… shame.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_5_Player_Any=Anyone in particular?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_6_Darol_NPC=Nah, I don't want any trouble…
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_7_Darol_NPC=…but if you dig, you'll find some pretty ugly stuff, I'm sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_8_Darol_NPC=You're welcome.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_9_Darol_NPC=Good hunting!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_10_Darol_NPC=So, did you find anything yet?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_11_Darol_NPC=I love the smell of an alchemists fire in the morning.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Informant_12_Darol_NPC=I'm Darol Granger, quartermaster.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_1_Denila_NPC=What is it?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_2_Denila_NPC=Oh, it's you!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_3_Denila_NPC=I'm Lieutenant Highspirit, well done! I saw you fight down in the trenches.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_4_Player_Any=We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_5_Denila_NPC=Shoot.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_6_NOAUDIO_NOAUDIO=Where are you from?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_7_Player_Any=How long have you been serving here?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_8_Denila_NPC=I came to the front three months ago, when things began to… heat up.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_9_Denila_NPC=Are you from here?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_10_Denila_NPC=No, I was raised in the Elven Settlements.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_11_NOAUDIO_NOAUDIO=About potential leaks
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_12_Denila_NPC=What do you think about the repeated attacks on weak points in the lines of defense?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_13_Denila_NPC=I see where you going with that.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_14_Denila_NPC=It would seem logical that someone is working for Gallivan, telling them when and where to attack.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_15_Denila_NPC=Honestly, most of the officers aren't worthy of their title, but that's war.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_16_Denila_NPC=We need all the able hands we can get.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_17_Denila_NPC=Of course!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_18_Denila_NPC=Good luck to you, and stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_Accuse_1_Denila_NPC=What? How dare you?!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect01_Accuse_2_Denila_NPC=You haven't heard the last of me, I swear!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_1_Petra_NPC=What do you want?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_2_Petra_NPC=Lance Corporal Hillsborough.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_3_Petra_NPC=Let me tell you something…
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_4_Petra_NPC=…I know what they say about you.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_5_Petra_NPC=I don't believe a word of it.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_6_Player_Cynical=Oh, you don't believe in Soraks?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_7_Petra_NPC=I'm no fool, I've fought them.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_8_Player_Authority=Well, we still need to interrogate you.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_9_Petra_NPC=You have no authority to question me.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_10_Player_Authority=We'll still ask them. If you don't answer, that'll make you a prime suspect.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_11_Petra_NPC=Like I care.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_12_Petra_NPC=Since I was born. I'm from here, a real Itainen.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_13_Petra_NPC=This place is being corrupted by all these…
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_14_Petra_NPC=Dragonborn and tieflings, like we didn't have enough problems with the elves.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_15_Player_Authority=So that's your problem? Non-humans?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_16_Petra_NPC=Right now, you're my problem.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_17_Player_Authority=I think we've heard enough.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_18_Player_Cynical=I've met racists before, but she raises the bar to another level.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_Accuse_1_Petra_NPC=What?! You're insane! Are you working with them? Is that it?!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect02_Accuse_2_Petra_NPC=You're just like all of them. You're the traitors, not me!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_1_Karsen_NPC=My, my, what is going on?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_2_Karsen_NPC=Lord Karsen Synatir, and who might you be?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_3_Player_Any=We're Sorak hunters.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_4_Karsen_NPC=I see. Gallivan is just a few miles that way. You should go there.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_5_Karsen_NPC=I'm an infantry officer, and a good one at that.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_6_Karsen_NPC=On the frontline? Only a few months, but I do have twelve years in the clan's army.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_7_Karsen_NPC=Suspicious? I'm not sure what you would consider suspicious.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_8_Karsen_NPC=I suppose you mean Sorak infiltrators, impersonators, and such?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_9_Karsen_NPC=Well, it is war. People behave erratically, even some of my fellow officers, I'm afraid.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_10_Karsen_NPC=There is a lot of ambition around here.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_11_Karsen_NPC=Lowborns with a grudge against nobility, blatant racism… we have our own share of internal tensions.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_12_Karsen_NPC=Is that the work of Soraks? I couldn't say.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_13_Player_Any=Alright, well then, thank you for your insights.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_14_Karsen_NPC=Oh, I say, don't mention it.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_Accuse_1_Karsen_NPC=Oh, come on… I was doing such a good job here.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect03_Accuse_2_Karsen_NPC=But you had to make a mess of my operation, didn't you?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_1_Jaden_NPC=Clear skies.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_2_Jaden_NPC=Of course.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_3_Jaden_NPC=I'm a Warrant Officer, scouting division.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_4_Jaden_NPC=Not long, actually. I was drafted when the… war began.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_5_Jaden_NPC=I don't know what you mean.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_6_Jaden_NPC=It's war; battles, killing, blood, sweat, and tears…
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_7_Jaden_NPC=…this whole war is…
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_8_Jaden_NPC=…I'd rather not say.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_9_Player_Any=No one's happy about the war, son.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_10_Jaden_NPC=Then what are we dying for?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_11_Player_Any=Why? It's the Soraks, they control the Kingdom of Gallivan, they caused this.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_12_Jaden_NPC=Then to hell with them.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_Accuse_1_Jaden_NPC=What? You think I'm one of them?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect04_Accuse_2_Jaden_NPC=I'm out of here! Kill me if you think I'm a Sorak, I don't care anymore.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_1_Zarmir_NPC=Hey, what news, Heroes of the Rift?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_2_Zarmir_NPC=You can call me Zarmir.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_3_Player_Any=That's it?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_4_Zarmir_NPC=Well, Second Lieutenant Zarmir Ortus, if that's the way you want it?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_5_Player_Any=It's better.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_6_Zarmir_NPC=Come on, why so serious?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_7_Zarmir_NPC=Before the war began, I just wanted a peaceful job, but then bang! The war.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_8_Zarmir_NPC=My job? I told you, I'm an officer, I give orders, I tell people to go fight and die for land they don't own.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_9_Zarmir_NPC=I'm dodging arrows for now, but someday it'll be my turn.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_10_Zarmir_NPC=So, I'm trying my best to enjoy the time between battles.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_11_Zarmir_NPC=Pff, come on, half the people around here carry nondetection amulets…
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_12_Zarmir_NPC=…what do they have to hide?
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_13_Zarmir_NPC=One can wonder.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_14_Player_Any=You think there are traitors in your ranks, then.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_15_Zarmir_NPC=They have something to hide, for sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_16_Zarmir_NPC=See ya!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_Accuse_17_Zarmir_NPC=Are you kidding me? Look, I'm not hiding anything!
Narration/&DLC3_Gallivan_Suspect05_Accuse_18_Zarmir_NPC=Boooring, I'm out!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_1_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=Hey, you're the Heroes of the Rift, right?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_2_Suspect_Player=Guilty as charged.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_3_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=I thought you'd be taller… just kidding.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_4_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=Name's Wylin Yates. What can I do for you?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_5_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=About two years, I think.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_6_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=Apart from the commander having no sense of humor? Nope.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_ChoiceD=Is Garrad giving you a hard time?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_6_Suspect_Player=Is Garrad giving you a hard time, Wylin?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_7_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=Nah, it's just… well, he's really bossy.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_8_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=Don't get me in trouble.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_8_Player=Of course not.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_9_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=Good luck.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_13_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=I'm just a soldier.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_10_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=I won't accept that! You have no proof!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_11_Suspect_Wilyn_NPC=I'm out of here! This isn't the last you'll hear about this!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_7_Suspect_Jakelyn_NPC=What, me? A Sorak? That's a damn joke!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_8_Suspect_Jakelyn_NPC=I won't just stand here and be insulted!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_7_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=Preposterous! I'm an honest soldier!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_8_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=I'm going to make an official complaint about this!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_1_Suspect_Weyne_NPC=Weyne Tayler
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_2_Suspect_Weyne_NPC=Go ahead.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_3_Suspect_Weyne_NPC=I'm a crossbowman.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_4_Suspect_Weyne_NPC=It's been a long time, four years, maybe.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_5_Suspect_Weyne_NPC=Suspicious? No…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_6_Suspect_Weyne_NPC=Thank you.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_7_Suspect_Weyne_NPC=Fine, you got me. Now let me call a friend…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_1_Suspect_Brennen_NPC=Brennen Lingard
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_2_Suspect_Brennen_NPC=Of course!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_3_Suspect_Brennen_NPC=I'm a soldier.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_4_Suspect_Brennen_NPC=A year, or so.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_5_Suspect_Brennen_NPC=Eh, like what? No, I don't think so.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_6_Suspect_Brennen_NPC=Strike true.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_7_Suspect_Brennen_NPC=That's a pile of crap!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_8_Suspect_Brennen_NPC=Go get the real Soraks, you amateurs. I'm out!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_1_Suspect_Eythen_NPC=Etheyn Cook
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_2_Suspect_Eythen_NPC=Of course I've heard of you. It's an honor to meet you.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_3_Player=Don't mention it.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_3_Suspect_Eythen_NPC=No, I mean it. My name is Etheyn Cook. Corporal, for now.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_4_Suspect_Eythen_NPC=I joined last winter. Before this, I was posted near the Gallivan border.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_NOAUDIO_A=You don't want to remain a soldier?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_NOAUDIO_A_Player=Why do you say "for now"? You don't like your job?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_9_Suspect_Eythen_NPC=I have plans… I want to be a cleric.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_5_Suspect_Eythen_NPC=Nothing special, I suppose.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_6_Suspect_Eythen_NPC=Einar guide you.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_7_Suspect_Eythen_NPC=Say that again?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_8_Suspect_Eythen_NPC=I can't believe you think I'm one of them!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_1_NOAUDIO_A=You want to be a cleric?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_2_Player_Any=A cleric? Which deity do you pray to?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_3_Eythen_NPC=I follow Einar, I want to join the Order of the Blade.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_4_Player_Any=So it's a complete change of career?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_5_Eythen_NPC=Yes. What I saw on the border… the Soraks…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_11_Eythen_NPC=…I want to fight them, not their victims from Gallivan.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_6_NOAUDIO_B=You were on the border?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_7_Player_Any=You fought on the Gallivan border?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_8_Eythen_NPC=I did. I was so naive…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_9_Eythen_NPC=…I fought a Sorak, he killed two of my friends… right in front my eyes.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_08_10_Eythen_NPC=It was… terrifying.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_1_Suspect_Tea_NPC=A'ten'hut!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_2_Player=At ease, soldier. We're not your commander.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_3_Suspect_Tea_NPC=Sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_4_Player=Everything alright?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_5_Suspect_Tea_NPC=You tell me.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_NOAUDIO_Whatsyourname=What's your name?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_7_Suspect_Tea_NPC=You're mad! I'm innocent!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_8_Suspect_Tea_NPC=I can't take this. I'll be in my barracks. Talk to the commander.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A9_Tea_NPC=Tea Horvan, Corporal first class.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A10_Tea_NOAUDIO=You're very young for your rank.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A11_Player_Any=Corporal first class, at your age?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A12_Tea_NPC=I earned it.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A13_Player_Any=Of course.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A14_Tea_NPC=Am I being investigated?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A15_Player_Any=Everyone is.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A16_Tea_NPC=That's unfair.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A17_Tea_NOAUDIO=You're nervous.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A18_Tea_NPC=Why are you so nervous?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A19_Tea_NPC=I have a career. Your line of questioning will put a stain on my record.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A20_Player_Any=Not if you have nothing to hide.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A21_Player_Any=Who are you?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A22_Tea_NPC=Ten months.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A23_Tea_NPC=A bit of tension since you got here.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A24_Tea_NPC=I don't understand all this.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_1_Jakelyn_NPC=Hey.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_2_Jakelyn_NPC=What are fancy heroes like you doing here?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_3_Player_Any=Just helping the commander with something.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_4_Jakelyn_NPC=Interesting.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_5_NOAUDIO_NOAUDIO=What is interesting?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_5_Player=What do you mean "interesting"?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_6_Jakelyn_NPC=You're here to dig some dirt on us, aren't you?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_7_Player_Any=Do you have something to confess?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_8_Jakelyn_NPC=Me? Only that some of us have secret meetings at night, that's all.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_9_Player_Any=Would you care to tell us who has those meetings?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_10_Jakelyn_NPC=Can't say for sure… and I don't want to get the blame, or be a snitch.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_11_Player_Any=So, you're clean, but there is something to find, is that what you're saying?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_12_Jakelyn_NPC=Exactly.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_13_Jakelyn_NPC=Jakelyn Colban, I'm just a grunt.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_14_Jakelyn_NPC=Six months, give or take.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_03_15_Jakelyn_NPC=Stay in the light.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_1_Player_Any=Do you have a minute?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_2_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=Eh? Sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_3_Player_Any=What's your name, soldier?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_4_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=Lorna… Lorna Mighten, deputy.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_5_Player_Any=We're no longer deputies of the Council.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_6_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=Oh, sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_7_NOAUDIO_A=You look troubled.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_8_NOAUDIO_B=How long have you been here?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_9_NOAUDIO_C=Everything alright here?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_9_Player=Is everything alright in the garrison?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_10_Player=You look troubled. Is something wrong?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_10_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=No, I mean… I think we're all wondering… you know, what's with all the questions?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_11_Player_Any=We suspect wrongdoings in the fort.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_12_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=What? No, I mean, what kind of wrongdoing?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_13_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=Just… um, two months.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_14_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=Yes… everyone is, er… very nice.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_15_NOAUDIO_D=You don't look innocent.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_16_NOAUDIO_E=We'll come back.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_17_Player_D=We're not done with you.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_18_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=You seem awfully nervous for an innocent.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_19_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=I…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_20_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=I'm a good soldier, I'd give my life for my mates…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_21_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=…and my commander…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_04_22_Suspect_Lorna_NPC=…and the princess, of course!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_1_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=Harryn Surridge
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_2_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=Of course.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_3_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=Officer… well, trainee for now.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_4_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=Three years, two months, and seven days.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_5_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=Lack of discipline overall, but that's not what you mean, I suppose.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_6_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=Good luck to you.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_7_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=I can't believe you're doing this.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_8_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=My honor is stained, I'll have to resign.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_9_Aristocrat=Lack of discipline?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_10_Player_Aristocrat=I don't want to rat on my comrades…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_11_Player_Aristocrat=And yet?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_12_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=Leaving your post when on guard duty is a serious breach of regulations.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_13_Player_Aristocrat=You witnessed this?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_14_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=I did.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_15_Player_Aristocrat=We're going to need names.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Garrad_A_16_Suspect_Harryn_NPC=Private Lingard.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_1_Informant_NPC=It's true, you are the Heroes of the Rift!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_1b_Informant_NPC=I need your help!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_2_Player_Any=What's going on?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_3_Informant_NPC=Multiple homes were robbed recently, and no one knows who is responsible.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_4_Informant_Player_Any=And you? Do you suspect anyone?
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_5_Informant_NPC=I have an idea, but I don't want to say.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_6_Player=Just put us on the right track.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_7_Informant_NPC=We found claw marks in the robbed houses, so… you know what I'm thinking…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_8_Informant_NPC=Finnolir and Khainrra are at the inn almost every evening, getting drunk, so I doubt they'd be in shape for a robbery…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_9_Informant_NPC=We do have guards around here, but they don't seem to be concerned with doing their duty…
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Informant_10_Informant_NPC=I know it's not much, but maybe it will lead to something.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_1_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=Ah, the Heroes of the Rift! I am Beladiel Featherbrow, proud owner of the Auld Cedar!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_2_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=I know why you're here, but I'm telling you, it's just empty gossip. Everyone is afraid of Soraks at the moment.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_3_Suspect_Beladiel_Player=You don't believe they exist?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_4_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=Of course I do, I'm not stupid, but do you think they'd be rummaging in our houses? Really?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=Wouldn't they rather rip us apart?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_6_Suspect_Beladiel_Player=It is more complicated than that.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_7_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=Well, of course, you would know better.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_8_Suspect_Beladiel_Player=So, you don't have any useful information about the break-ins?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_9_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=It's probably just some folks trying to draw you into their petty feuds…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_10_Suspect_Beladiel_Player=Like, who?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_11_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=Nah, I'm not naming names. Just keep an eye out.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_12_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=See you around, my dear customers!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_13_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=Me? Seventy two years and three months, yep!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_14_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=I'm a pillar of this community! I'm going to complain to the Elder!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_15_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=You suspect me? Really, this is quite ridiculous!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_16_Suspect_Beladiel_NPC=I am a pillar of this community. I'll complain to the Elder!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_1_Suspect_Galfin_NPC=Galfin Leafcutter, proud owner of this shop.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_2_Suspect_Galfin_NPC=Interested in some equipment, maybe?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_2b_Suspect_Galfin_PLayer=We're here about the robberies.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_3_Suspect_Galfin_NPC=Oh, I see.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_4_Suspect_Galfin_NPC=Well, I'm not as venerable as our Elder, but I've been around for three hundred years, give or take.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5_Suspect_Galfin_NPC=I haven't been robbed, but then I don't spend the night drunk on ale, if you know what I mean.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5b_Suspect_Galfin_Player=No, what do you mean?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5c_Suspect_Galfin_Player=I don't believe in stories of Soraks breaking into houses just to steal a few trinkets…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5d_Suspect_Galfin_Player=…but drunks wandering around at night, and doing nothing at all during the day… troublemakers.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5e_Suspect_Galfin_Player=Beladiel, who owns the Auld Cedar, she makes a fortune with those two, but she'll never rat on a customer.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_6_Suspect_Galfin_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_7_Suspect_Galfin_NPC=You've got to be kidding me? I'm not a thief!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_8_Suspect_Galfin_NPC=This is absolutely insulting!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_1_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=My name is Finnolir Coldmoss, nice to meet you.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_2_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=Well, of course, why not?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_3_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=I'm a patrician, that's like a noble in common parlance.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_4_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=Well, I arrived here twenty years ago, and I never left.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=One morning, I found my door lock had been broken. Didn't wake me up, though.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5b_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=I heard that lot of houses around the shop were robbed, but not the shop itself.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_NOAUDIO=About the robberies.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5d_Player=Do you know something about the break-ins?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5c_Player=What are you implying?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_6_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=Nothing. The shop probably has more security, maybe a protection spell?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_6b_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=Good hunting, Heroes of the Rift!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_7_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=No, what do you mean?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_8_Suspect_Finnolir_NPC=Shame on you! Blaming an honest citizen!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_1_Suspect_Khainrra_NPC=I am Khainrra Elktree.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_2_Suspect_Khainrra_NPC=It is an honor. Please, what can I do for you?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_3_Suspect_Khainrra_NPC=I'm a patrol guard, a volunteer.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_4_Suspect_Khainrra_NPC=I was born here, I never left.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5_Suspect_Khainrra_NPC=Eh? No. I know it's my job to watch, but… well, I didn't notice anything. Sorry.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_6_Suspect_Khainrra_NPC=See you around.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_7_Suspect_Khainrra_NPC=I can't believe you're doing this!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_8_Suspect_Khainrra_NPC=My honor is ruined. I'm going to have to resign my post.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_1_Suspect_Lemreth_NPC=Sir! I'm Lemreth Brighthand, sir!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_2_Suspect_Lemreth_NPC=Yes, sir!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_3_Suspect_Lemreth_NPC=I'm a guard in the city patrol, sir!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_4_Suspect_Lemreth_NPC=I arrived at the settlement two years ago, enlisted right away, sir!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_5_Suspect_Lemreth_NPC=A bit of argy-bargy around the inn, sir! Nothing alarming, sir!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_6_Suspect_Lemreth_NPC=At your service, sir!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_ElvenSettlement_A_7_Suspect_Lemreth_NPC=Yes, sir! Saw through the stupid act, did you? You got me! Now prepare to die!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Return_To_Informant_1_Informant_NPC=That was a hell of a battle! I've never seen anything like it!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Return_To_Informant_2_Player_Any=You were right to alert us, this… creature could have done a lot more damage.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Return_To_Informant_3_Informant_NPC=I thought the elf was… no, I had no idea.
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Return_To_Informant_4_Informant_NPC=Thank you for saving us!
Narration/&DLC3_ElvenSettlement_Return_To_Informant_5_Informant_Player_Any=You're most welcome. Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Informant_1_Informant_NPC=Cylia Ironmist
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Informant_2_Informant_NPC=I'm the Captain of the Watch.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Informant_3_Informant_NPC=Indeed, there are a few things. Three of the guards missed their shift three nights ago, when the elevator was destroyed.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Informant_4_Informant_NPC=One of the engineers, Agneta, was nowhere to be found that night.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Informant_5_Informant_NPC=Also I've seen reports that one elf, a civilian, was spotted wandering around the elevator.
Narration/&DLC3_WhiteCity_Informant_6_Informant_NPC=I hope you find the culprit. Here you go, I drafted a list of suspects.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_AboutThatNight_NOAUDIO=About three nights ago.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_AboutThatNight_Player=There was an incident with the elevator three nights ago. Where were you?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_1_Suspect_Hugor_NPC=Name's Hugor Strongflint.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_2_Suspect_Hugor_NPC=Sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_3_Suspect_Hugor_NPC=Well I'm a proud city guard, a Hopajakar if you wanna know.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_4_Suspect_Hugor_NPC=Been living here for almost fifty years.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_5_Suspect_Hugor_NPC=Oh, man, I was at home that night, deathly ill. There should be a note on my service record in the Central Clan House, if you want to check.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_6_Suspect_Hugor_NPC=Stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_7_Suspect_Hugor_NPC=Are you kidding, me? I'm not a traitor!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_8_Suspect_Hugor_NPC=I won't just stand here being insulted!

Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_3_Suspect_Arwynn_NPC=I'm a logistician. I know, it is a strange word. I plan the delivery of goods for the city's shops.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_3b_Suspect_Arwynn_NPC=I take the elevator ten times a day, hands full of papers!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_4_Suspect_Arwynn_NPC=Funny that you ask. I'm going to be celebrating a century of service very soon.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_5_Suspect_Arwynn_NPC=Let me think… Ah, yes, it was my day off. I remember because I spent the night at the tavern.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_5b_Suspect_Arwynn_NPC=Ah, that was a fun night, two guards at each other's throats. Haha.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_5c_Suspect_Arwynn_NPC=One of them accused the other of being a cheat… called him Rubert, I think.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_6_Suspect_Arwynn_NPC=Good luck to you.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_7_Suspect_Arwynn_NPC=What? Me? You're not making any sense!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_8_Suspect_Arwynn_NPC=My honor is forever stained. I'll have to retire.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_1_Suspect_Alcor_NPC=Alcor Stormwise.

Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_6_Suspect_Alcor_NPC=Strike true!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_7_Suspect_Alcor_NPC=Damn you! How did you work it out?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_1_Suspect_Gorwong_NPC=I am Gorwong Strongstone.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_2_Suspect_Gorwong_NPC=Yep.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_3_Suspect_Gorwong_NPC=Pronsjakar, a regular foot soldier. I patrol the city.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_4_Suspect_Gorwong_NPC=Been here almost twelve years now.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_5_Suspect_Gorwong_NPC=I was on duty, didn't notice anything special.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_6_Suspect_Gorwong_NPC=If you find the jerk who broke our elevator, please break his head of my behalf!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_7_Suspect_Gorwong_NPC=No way!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_8_Suspect_Gorwong_NPC=I won't stand by and watch some amateur detective fooling around!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_1_Suspect_Rubert_NPC=Name is Rubert Fairstone.

Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_5_Suspect_Rubert_NPC=I only know that I was half drunk at the inn, and that Gorwong owes me ten gold pieces!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_6_Suspect_Rubert_NPC=You take care.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_7_Suspect_Rubert_NPC=Say that again?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_WhiteCity_A_8_Suspect_Rubert_NPC=I can't believe you think I'm one of them!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_1_Suspect_Berghild_NPC=You again? What do you want?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_2_Suspect_Berghild_NPC=None of your business. "Kultajakar" will be enough.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_3_Suspect_Berghild_NPC=Do you even listen to me? It's Kultajakar!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_4_Player_NOAUDIO_A=An impressive rank!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_4_Suspect_Berghild_Player=A high-ranking officer. Come on, we're on your side.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5_Suspect_Berghild_NPC=Well, you know your classics. That's a start.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6_Suspect_Berghild_NPC=Long enough to know that busybodies like you are not welcome here.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_7_Suspect_Berghild_NPC=Take a look behind me, tell me if you notice anything suspicious.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_8_Suspect_Berghild_NPC=…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_9_Suspect_Berghild_NPC=You are way out of line!

Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_3_Suspect_Eivar_NPC=I'm a Pronsjakar. A simple soldier, if you like.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_4_Suspect_Eivar_Player=Well, I bet you are.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5_Suspect_Eivar_NPC=It wasn't me, it wasn't my idea!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6_Suspect_Eivar_Player=But we haven't asked you anything yet!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_7_Suspect_Eivar_NPC=About three months.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_8_Suspect_Eivar_Player_NOAUDIO=Not your idea?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_8_Suspect_Eivar_Player=What do you mean "not your idea"?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_9_Suspect_Eivar_NPC=It was Dana's…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_10_Suspect_Eivar_NPC=She asked me to steal these bottles from the central storeroom.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_11_Suspect_Eivar_Player=It looks like she didn't drink alone.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_12_Suspect_Eivar_NPC=With all those carts waiting, I just had to reach out… Please don't tell her.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_13_Suspect_Eivar_Player=Thanks for your time, Eivar.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_14_Suspect_Eivar_NPC=Cheers… I mean, stay in the light!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_15_Suspect_Eivar_NPC=What, me, a Sorak? You have to be joking!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_16_Suspect_Eivar_NPC=I won't just stand here to be insulted!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_1_Suspect_Dana_NPC=Oh, great, strangers coming to meddle in our little lives…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_2_Suspect_Dana_NPC=Dana Vasco
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_2b_Suspect_Dana_NPC=This is important.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_2c_Suspect_Dana_NPC=Yeah, sure.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_3_Suspect_Dana_NPC=Something wrong, soldier?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_3b_Suspect_Dana_NPC=I know the drill, Pronsjakar Dana Vasco, reporting for duty…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_4_Suspect_Dana_NPC=…Served for three years under Kultajakar Strongspine…
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5_Suspect_Dana_NPC=…Nothing but miners complaining. Happy?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5b_Suspect_Dana_NPC=Your cooperation is appreciated, Pronsjakar.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6_Suspect_Dana_Player_NOAUDIO=What about Eivar?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6_Suspect_Dana_Player=Tell us about Pronsjakar Eivar Grimcrest.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_7_Suspect_Dana_NPC=Well, he hasn't been here long, but he's a good companion.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_8_Suspect_Dana_Player_NOAUDIO=Eivar has denounced you.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_8_Suspect_Dana_Player=Eivar told us that you asked him to steal some bottles in the Low City.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_9_Suspect_Dana_NPC=Dirty bastard!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_10_Suspect_Dana_Player=We are not interested in your little arrangement. Anything about the pit?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_11_Suspect_Dana_NPC=Well, you got me… Berghild has been watching Dren and Priniwyn closely recently.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_13_Suspect_Dana_NPC=That's preposterous, I'm an honest soldier!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_14_Suspect_Dana_NPC=I'm going to complain about this, officially!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_1_Suspect_Dren_NPC=What can I do for you?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_2_Suspect_Dren_NPC=Name's Dren Ice-Eye. Please don't misspell it.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_3_Suspect_Dren_NPC=Never mind… what do you need?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_4_Suspect_Dren_NPC=Too long.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5_Suspect_Dren_NPC=Not much, it's pretty routine.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6_Suspect_Dren_Player_NOAUDIO=What about your routine?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6a_Suspect_Dren_NPC=Dying of boredom, apparently.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6b_Suspect_Dren_NPC=Sorry, it's just so… the only excitement we had in years was to blow up the well.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6c_Suspect_Dren_Player=About that, what was the reason?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6d_Suspect_Dren_NPC=You'd have to ask Berghild, she gives the orders.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6e_Suspect_Dren_NPC=And you're alive, well done.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6f_Suspect_Dren_NPC=Anytime!
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_7_Suspect_Dren_NPC=Okay, you got me, but you won't leave this place alive!

Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_2_Suspect_Alvig_NPC=Are you Pronsjakar Alvig Chillhand?

Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_4_Suspect_Alvig_NPC=Six months.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5_Suspect_Alvig_Player_NOAUDIO=Anything about the pit?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5_Suspect_Alvig_Player=Do you know anything about the pit?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5a_Suspect_Alvig_NPC=Not much to say. I'm glad the well is blocked. The noises coming from down there gave me the creeps.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5b_Suspect_Alvig_Player_NOAUDIO=What have you heard?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_5b_Suspect_Alvig_Player=What kind of noises?
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_6_Suspect_Alvig_NPC=Weird grunts. Never heard anything like it. Sounded like a nightmare.
Narration/&DLC3_Suspect_Undermountain_A_7_Suspect_Alvig_NPC=That's a pile of crap!

Narration/&DLC3_ConversationBanter_WhiteCity_Refugees_A_1=Those poor people. They had to flee from terrifying creatures, they say.
Narration/&DLC3_ConversationBanter_WhiteCity_Refugees_A_2=Giants?
Narration/&DLC3_ConversationBanter_WhiteCity_Refugees_A_3=Um, yes. Aren't they terrifying?

Narration/&DLC3_ConversationBanter_ElvenSettlements_Conflict_1=Sharpmind… <i>Slowmind</i> if you ask me. He is no longer capable of shouldering the greatness of our ancestors or bringing back the splendors of yesteryear that are ours.
Narration/&DLC3_ConversationBanter_Gallivan_Family_1=I haven't been back to Valkarokkopun in so long. I don't remember the sound of the Eulalia anymore.

As with many Imperial families of that time, his family was originally a minor branch of the clan and began to rise to prominence after the Cataclysm, as it backed the first Emperor ("The Wailing Emperor") who took the rough decisions ultimately leading to the survival of Civilization and to the rise of the New Empire. More than anybody else of his generation, Ilastar is aware of what was lost and was a major proponent of participating to the Council, in the hope of gathering magical materials and writings expanding his knowledge of magic and thus giving the empire an edge in future conflicts. His main worry is that historical documents come to the fore, revealing some truths better left alone.

Tip/&LoadingTip01=Casting spells consumes spell slots. Most classes regain spell slots after a long rest.
Tip/&LoadingTip02=When rolling an attack or ability check with advantage, two d20s are rolled and the better result is used. When rolling with disadvantage, the worst result is kept.
Tip/&LoadingTip03=Open the Journal screen ($Shortcut[PartyJournal]) to consult your party progress, objectives, and achievements.
Tip/&LoadingTip04=You can customize your 3D dice in the Game Settings.
Tip/&LoadingTip05=Spells consume spell slots when cast, unlike cantrips which can be cast at will.
Tip/&LoadingTip06=Taking a long rest is the main way to recover all your spell slots, although wizards can use Arcane Recovery to recover a few low-level slots during short rests.
Tip/&LoadingTip07=Most spellcasters cannot use all the spells they know. They need to prepare a number of them and take a long rest.
Tip/&LoadingTip08=Wizards must learn new spells and write them in their spellbook before they can prepare and cast them.
Tip/&LoadingTip09=Clerics and paladins always know all the spells they can cast at their level, but still need to prepare those they want to be able to cast.
Tip/&LoadingTip10=Wizard spell scrolls are destroyed after casting. Wizards can also copy a spell from a scroll into their spellbook to acquire them, which also destroys the scroll.
Tip/&LoadingTip13=Some creatures are afraid of light and can even be hurt by it, allowing you to use light as a weapon.
Tip/&LoadingTip14=To perform a long rest, you must find a suitable place: either an inn such as the Gravekeep's Cask, or a campfire when exploring.
Tip/&LoadingTip15=In each turn of battle, a character has a main action and a bonus action. The main action is used to move or attack, for instance, while bonus actions are granted by specific class features, spells, or powers.
Tip/&LoadingTip16=Reactions allow them to interrupt someone else's action, for instance, to perform an opportunity attack. Each character can make one reaction, and recover it at the start of their next turn.
Tip/&LoadingTip17=Some characters or monsters can attack more than once per turn, and can move between attacks.
Tip/&LoadingTip18=Shoving can push an enemy one cell away or put them down until they get up. Enemies can shove, too.
Tip/&LoadingTip19=Dodging is a powerful defense even if it uses your main action: enemies have disadvantage on hitting you for the remainder of your turn.
Tip/&LoadingTip20=Switch to cautious mode when exploring. You'll be slow, but better able to notice traps and footsteps.
Tip/&LoadingTip21=In combat, you can move normally and then dash as your main action to go twice as far.
Tip/&LoadingTip22=Most characters can jump two cells without a problem. Longer jumps require strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. You always have a chance to fall prone when landing if you jump far.
Tip/&LoadingTip23=Most characters can climb two cells without a problem. Climbing higher requires strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. Some characters, like thieves or darkweavers, have superior climbing abilities.
Tip/&LoadingTip25=After moving the camera around to examine your surroundings, you can center on a character and follow them. Either double-click the character's portrait or press TAB while controlling this character.
Tip/&LoadingTip26=To better navigate in three dimensions, activate/deactivate the camera planar mode, with the button in the center of the compass (bottom right of the screen).
Tip/&LoadingTip27=Flying spells or artifacts can let you move almost anywhere you want. But losing concentration means falling - possibly to your death.
Tip/&LoadingTip28=When a battle starts, all creatures involved roll initiative to determine the play order. High dexterity raises your initiative.
Tip/&LoadingTip29=Battles sometimes begin with one side being surprised. Surprised characters or creatures cannot act during the first round of battle.
Tip/&LoadingTip30=You can set up weapon slots to change quickly from sword and shield to bow, for example, or to draw a torch along with a one-handed weapon. Prepare any combo you like.
Tip/&LoadingTip31=Many consumables can be set up in the utility slot, making them available more quickly than the inventory would.
Tip/&LoadingTip32=When you find a mysterious item, use Detect Magic first to determine whether it has magical properties. If it does, use Identify to learn how to use it.
Tip/&LoadingTip33=Ingredients are various items like flowers, powders, and magic gems, allowing you to craft a variety of items, from healing potions to powerful magic swords.
Tip/&LoadingTip34=To craft, you need the relevant proficiency. Your ability scores matter, too. For instance, to craft a scroll you need proficiency with the scroll kit, and Arcana will help a lot.
Tip/&LoadingTip35=Crafting can be performed during downtime while traveling. A character with a crafting operation in progress works on their task before sleeping.
Tip/&LoadingTip36=Personality flags influence the dialog lines spoken by a character. They don't make choices for you - they simply change the flavor of the experience.
Tip/&LoadingTip37=When speaking to an NPC, the most suitable character in the party will automatically use Insight to guess which approach is most likely to work with them.
Tip/&LoadingTip38=Your group has a specific level of relations with each of the game's factions. The more they like you, the more items they will sell you, and the lower their prices will be.
Tip/&LoadingTip39=When bringing back items from the Badlands, choose which faction to sell them to. This will influence your relations with them.
Tip/&LoadingTip40=Disengage can be used as a main action, allowing you to move outside the enemies' range without risking opportunity attacks.
Tip/&LoadingTip41=When an enemy is in a neighboring cell, you are engaged. If you move away from that enemy, you risk suffering an opportunity attack.
Tip/&LoadingTip42=Rogues can use sneak attack to increase their damage when they attack an enemy that is in a cell next to an ally, unless they have disadvantage on their attack roll.
Tip/&LoadingTip43=Wielding two light weapons allows you to perform a second attack with your bonus actions. Both weapons need the Light tag.
Tip/&LoadingTip44=Wielding a finesse weapon allows you to use Dexterity as the main ability score for the attack, if it is better than Strength. Check for the Finesse tag.
Tip/&LoadingTip45=A weapon with the Versatile tag can be used with one or two hands. If you leave the second hand slot empty, you'll deal more damage with such a weapon. Example: a longsword.
Tip/&LoadingTip47=To level up, your characters need to take a long rest. They will gain their new power when waking up.
Tip/&LoadingTip12=At the edge of your light sources, the environment is in dim light. You don't need Darkvision to see in dim light.
Tip/&LoadingTip11=Lighting is a crucial element of the game; characters without Darkvision will attack an unlit foe with disadvantage. Use torches and light spells to illuminate your environment.
Tip/&LoadingTip46=To split a stack of items, drag and drop the stack onto an empty cell while holding down the CTRL key. This will take one unit from the stack.
Tip/&LoadingTip24=Levitation spells and artifacts allow you to float up or down instead of climbing. You can also force an enemy to float in mid-air instead of rushing toward you if its size is medium or smaller.
Tip/&LoadingTip48=You can change the difficulty settings of the game on the fly at any time.
Tip/&LoadingTip49=If you experience lag/latency in multiplayer, lower the graphical settings/quality level on the slowest machines.
Tip/&LoadingTip25Gamepad=Hold <sprite index={10}> and select the same character twice, or press <sprite index={3}> to center the camera on the first character of the party.
Tip/&LoadingTip46Gamepad=To split a stack of items, double-press <sprite index={0}> or open the item menu by pressing <sprite index={7}>
