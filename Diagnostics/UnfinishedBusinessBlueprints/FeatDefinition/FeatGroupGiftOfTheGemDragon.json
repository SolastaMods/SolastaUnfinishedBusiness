The creature that dealt damage to you must make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 force damage, is pushed up to 10 feet away from you, and is forced prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed nor forced prone. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",
