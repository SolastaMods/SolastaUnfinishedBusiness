Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content	It has now been one week since we were transported to this wretched place! I think the gods have abandoned us! Of our monastery, the only building missing is the temple and its two resident priests! In its place, we have this weird construction, just out of reach of the pier, which we can't even enter. \n\nAll the survivors are scared. They are turning to me for comforting words, but I am only a novice, not yet ready to be a priest. Like them, I am a refugee who fled Sorr-Tarr and his vile servant.\n\nI do not know where we are, but we are far from home. Our little valley is a small pocket of Tirmar, lost - I don't know where!
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content2	Strange beasts roam the night, but for some reason they do not dare to enter our valley.\n\nI buried my daughter last night. She died as much from despair as from the rockslide and the earthquake. Now, I wait for my own end.\n\nTraveler - if you read this, say a prayer for our souls, for I cannot. I reject the gods whose folly brought us here! I curse them all!\n\nThe beasts have grown bolder, but they still avoid our valley. A pity, since I could use the meat. I am surviving on grain and vegetables, but solitude makes for hard labor and my strength is not what it was.
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content3	It has been 40 years. I am the last one, an old man now! I buried them all - all! But I could not bring myself to give the last rites. No - the gods left us to rot here, and I refused to send our souls back to them!\n\nEmtan Darwaz, last of the Sandblaze Monastery

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal01_text2	Once we find the stairs we need to go down, go up.

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal02_text1	Last night we finally found the stairs! I think Aksha was holding back on us, because they're not real stairs - just some kind of symbol…
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal02_text2	In the morning we will start again and this time we will follow the path to the maze's exit. I now am very sure the main stair in the middle of the maze is actually the way out.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AdventurerJournal02_text3	I was right! We followed the sign and it seems to work - we're getting closer to the main stair. Today we found two new symbols and… Wait! I don't think we're alone in the maze. I can hear them coming towards me. We will move away from that room and try to hide until…

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_Description	A locked book containing Aksha's notes since her arrival at the Keep.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text1	Lizzaria sent another party of her stupid zombies. One of them was an ogre, as if that would make things harder. Reek and Filth took care of it - I didn't even have to walk out. When will she understand that her attempts are useless? I'm getting tired of pretending to ignore who sends these monsters. I'm also getting tired of Mardracht. The old elf is powerful, for sure, but his mind is in decay. While he barricades himself in his solar, I've read all his damn books, but learned almost nothing.
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text2	A Doom Gem. It took me forever to imbue it enough power to make it worthwhile. I still don't understand how the wizards of Manacalon could have done it in less than a year. Anyway, now I could use it to craft a nice weapon, but to what end? Killing Lizarria's zombies? I'm losing interest in the project now the difficult part is done. I don't need a magic dagger to make my enemies bleed.\n
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text3	Reek is a good minion. He used to be handsome, but undeath doesn't suit him. Now he's just an obedient little pawn. Who would guess he was once a nobleman? I kept his armor and shield - he doesn't need them any more. Filth was always scum, but now at least she is of some use. She brings corpses to feed the ghouls, so I don't have to walk through piles of rotting fools. I'm thinking of creating another Brood, though. A nice, meaty Brood of Flesh would be nice. Maybe next month.

My thoughts are with you, and I hope we will be reunited one day and live in peace at last.\nWe hoped for a friendly and peaceful world, far from the reach of the Enemy, but alas, we have found only fresh enemies, and our seers tell me that the Sorr-Akkath are not far behind. The war is not over, and we must also face these Manacalons.\nThey wield magic as potent as that of any priest, yet the High Priest assures us that there are no gods in this world.\nThese are dark times, and they will test us, but this world is our last hope.\nMay the Lord of Valor watch over you, my love.\nArtus

Of course, only Laerin has the magical knowledge to complete the… miracle. Arun pardon me for this word, but what this elvish magic can accomplish is simply god-like. \nAlas, our troops are massing to besiege the Rift and stop the enemy once and for all. I am ready for my first magical weapon, a gift for my Lady Karyn. She is already a formidable fighter, but with the blade Laerin will enchant, she will be even more so. \nI have collected various enchantments, and I am not sure yet which one will please her most.

Equipment/&HectorLetterContent1	It was a bad plan; I said so from the start. It took me a month to master Griff's full appearance and a year to build the spider cult. The orcs are now loyal to me and eager to follow me to war, but the Scavengers have found the city and started encroaching on the orcs' territory. I decided to use the orcs ahead of schedule and wipe out the Scavengers. There were only a dozen of them, but they put up more of a fight than I expected, and I had to change the plan again. I sacrificed more orcs to capture their leader, a man named Hector. I will cancel the operation with the spider cult, and take the appearance of this Hector. A prominent member of the Scavengers could be useful. I must spend time alone with him deeper in the ruins, where the orcs don't go.
Equipment/&HectorLetterContent2	I'm leaving this note in case the Tshar sends for me. I might not get out alive. I made a mistake going so deep, so near the amphitheater. The deep spiders are much more numerous than I thought, and they have killed my prisoner. I won't be able to become Hector. The mission is a complete failure and I will answer to the Tshar - if I survive. I will try to escape by climbing up the amphitheater, but the spiders might be too fast for me. Glory to Sorr-Tarr!

Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Title	A handwritten, leather-bound book
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Description	The Journal of Angbi Kramsson, of the Guild of Antiquarians.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content01	If found, please return to the Guild of Antiquarians at Caer Cyflen. A reward will be offered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content02	Surroundings, continued …castle architecture is of First Expansion style, with many repairs and additions. A standard founding plaque: "Caer Tenarion", built by the 25th Iron Legion in the 24th year of Gwaltrian the Third - year 1557 in the Manacalon calendar, or 1486 before the Cataclysm. Presumably built to pacify the surrounding area.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content03	Later, same day. My initial impression confirmed: the castle is occupied. I encountered a patrol of skeletons led by a wraith who gave his name as Adam the Twelfth, a former Imperial officer and now captain of the castle's guard. He questioned me closely and gave me permission to research outside the castle, but not to approach the castle or try to enter. The lord, whose name he gave as Mardracht, does not receive visitors. Indeed, the captain admitted that he himself had not seen or spoken with his master in several centuries.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content04	Graveyard, continued …no gravestone shows a burial date later than the Cataclysm: no new burials in more than a thousand years. Possibly all in the castle are undead, like their guards. Impossible to confirm since I am refused admission.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content05	Substantial mausoleum at far end of the cemetery, built in First Expansion style. Inscription over doorway names 25th Iron Legion. Presumably officers were buried inside (and possibly in catacombs beneath, if the building filled up over time) while lower ranks occupy the surrounding graveyard.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content06	The following day, continued …as I continued to document the graveyard, a pack of wolves arrived from the north, led by a human man - or so he seemed. Met by captain and guards. Conversed for several minutes, manner guarded but not unfriendly. The captain pointed in my direction, clearly informing the man of my presence. No one in the group showed any interest in me.
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content07	Later, same day: An elven woman came out of the mausoleum, accompanied by several others: elves and humans, all apparently alive. They could not have entered the mausoleum without my seeing them. Two questions arise:
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content08	Another way into the mausoleum? Possible catacombs beneath - underground passage into the castle?
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content09	2. Living souls in the castle, yet no burials newer than 1,000 years? Two possibilities: life magically prolonged (necromancy? Fits with undead guard I encountered) and/or bodies not buried upon death (also compatible with necromancy).
Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content10	I watched from hiding as they explored the graveyard, apparently looking for something (me?). Extreme caution is indicated from now on.

Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content01	…upstairs to try to speak with Mardracht about it, but Aksha said he was resting and had left orders not to be disturbed - as usual. She offered to pass on a message - so helpful! - but I know it will never reach him.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content02	For all I know she's told him I'm dead. She may be planning to make it true. He's so shaken and addled from the Cataclysm, he'd probably believe her. She could have killed him already - he could have been dead for centuries - but no: his magical defenses are still in place. He must be alive.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content03	If only I could reach him - free him from her influence - but I can't get past her and her ghouls. So frustrating! I need to arrange a sudden meeting with a wooden stake, but she's careful.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content04	Adam's no help. He won't join me against Aksha without orders from Mardracht, which of course can't come because she's got him isolated. How blind is he not to see that - I'll never yield the castle to her, no matter what she does. While Mardracht lives, I have to keep trying to save him.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content05	…searching the graveyard as usual. The dwarf was there - he always thought I didn't see him, but I did - but now he's a ghost. Adam said he was an Antiquarian, some sort of scholar, so I tried to control him and find out what he knows.
Equipment/&Necromancy_LizzariasJournal_Content06	I was over-eager, though, and he got away. An opportunity lost. He might know something that could help me get past Aksha and her ghouls and free Mardracht from her influence. Someday, somehow, I will get rid of her. I will.

Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Title	On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Description	An ancient-looking book, with the eight rings of the Arcaneum embossed into the cover. 
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content01	On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods, and Its Particular Implications for Necromancy. By Alithariel Threanin, Postulant Junior Master of the Arcaneum, School of Necromancy. Academic Session of 3044, Imperial Calendar
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content02	As my thesis in support of my candidacy for the rank of Junior Master of the Arcaneum at the School of Necromancy, I respectfully submit the results of my research into the nature and types of new magics brought to Solasta by the humans of Tirmar, in particular the effectiveness of those whom they call "clerics" in repelling and destroying undead creatures. This knowledge is of urgent importance as we struggle to understand these humans, and assess both the severity of the threat they may post to the Empire and the potential benefit they could bring to it once conquered.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content03	It is widely known that the magic of humans derives from the entities they call "gods" ("goddesses" in the feminine, and "deities" collectively). I call it "divine magic" in this thesis, to distinguish it from our own arcane magic that is the result of magical study. Just as arcane magic is organized into schools, some divine magic is comprised of eight areas of study, which the humans call "domains." Each deity typically provides its clerics with access to two domains, representing its particular interests. The domain that corresponds most closely to the School of Necromancy is called the Domain of Oblivion.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content04	In addition to spells from two domains, a cleric has access to a wide array of other spells and powers, which are common to all regardless of their patron deity. Many are broadly similar in their effects to the spells of the School of Necromancy. There are two necromantic powers, though, that are completely new and unique: a cleric of any Tirmarian deity, if their rank is high enough, can repel undead creatures and even destroy them. The humans I have questioned believe that this is because their deities regard all undead creatures as "unnatural" - a word that reveals much about their primitive level of sophistication - and therefore undesirable, but they seem to know nothing about the means by which this result is achieved, speaking only about the "will" or "power" of their deities.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content05	The following pages examine the phenomenon of "turning" and destroying undead using both the classical thaumatological approach of Fathirien and her successors, and the more modern methods championed by Gorlindrien and the Practicalists. All conclusions are tentative. If this thesis is accepted, I propose to make this phenomenon my primary research topic.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Title	Torn Page
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Description	A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content01	…as the Soraks followed humanity, a high priest of Oblivion succumbed to despair and madness. He tainted the peace of the grave with the uncleanliness of undeath, raising the fallen to muster an army. As he knew this was not a prayer that would gain the favor of Maraike, the lady of life and death, he and his followers couched their plan in the form of a curse instead, tricking their goddess into ensuring that their plan would succeed. Maraike granted their plea, but was not deceived. She cursed the conspirators as well, for they had been corrupted by evil and were denied her grace. They became the fallen, and those they raised from death became sorrow zombies, named after the curse of sorrow that they had wrought.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content02	Maraike's punishment ensured that none of the fallen could enjoy the touch of light without suffering and dying. They must forever skulk in the shadows until they repented. But Maraike's punishment was not all. Sorr-Tarr, the vile god of the Soraks, saw potential in the fallen. Without undoing Maraike's curse, he gave them powers to do evil: to corrupt others by their touch, and to create fouler servants than zombies. Of the original fallen not much is known, save that there were twelve of them, priests and paladins…
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Title	Torn Page
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Description	A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content01	…the humans explained that they had fled to Solasta from their home, a world they called Tirmar, and that they were pursued by a race they called Sorr-Akkath or Soraks, which had spread across this world of Tirmar, and threatened to conquer all others.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content02	The Governor received them with the appearance of kindness, reasoning that if they came as supplicant fugitives it would be an easy task to subdue them, and either set them to work as slaves alongside the inferior races of Solasta or bind them over to the wizards of the Arcaneum for dissection or whatever other form of study might prove most fruitful. When the guards sought to bind the humans, though, they called upon beings they called "gods," and manifested powerful magics that took their hosts by surprise. Thus they were able to escape.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Title	Torn Page
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Description	A page apparently torn from a book, crumpled and thrown on the floor.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content01	…deities of Tirmar are a source of a new and unknown kind of magic. The humans believe they are powerful entities, perhaps extraplanar in nature, whom they worship and whose commands they follow, receiving power in return.
Equipment/&Necromancy_Gods_Content02	The humans are careful to distinguish between "good" and "evil" deities. "Good" deities are those whom the humans see as helpful to them, and - in their theology at least - concerned with their welfare. "Evil" deities are those who are hostile to humans and support the efforts of other races to conquer them. It was an "evil" deity and his followers - one Sorr-Tarr and the race of the Sorr-Akkath, or Soraks - who drove the humans to try to escape their home world of Tirmar, they say. Their arrival on Solasta…
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Title	The Time of the Dragons
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Description	An old book with the image of a dragon embossed on the cover.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content01	There was a time, very long ago, when dragons were the rulers of Solasta. They lived in the mountains, close to volcanoes which they loved for their heat - for nothing else was hot enough to incubate a dragon's egg. At that time the dwarves had not yet come up from below ground, being more rock than flesh, and the halflings remained in their swamps, far from anyone. And what of the elves? The elves were in and of the air, without physical form but existing as swirling currents of air and mana, one with magic and with the world.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content02	Eventually, however, the elves tired of a life of pure spirit and wind. They took a physical form and began to build great spires and palaces, bringing the beauty of their thoughts into material being. The dragons feared them, and a great war ensued, pitting fire and magic against air and magic until the elves…
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Title	The Good Management of Servants
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Description	An old book that seems to have been well-thumbed.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content01	The supreme duty of the head of a household is the management of servants. This is more important even than the welfare of the family, because a household can survive internal strife and injustice, but it cannot survive a breakdown in discipline. Heed well the lessons of history, and keep thoughts of revolt from the minds of your slaves.
Equipment/&Abjuration_Housekeeping_Content02	Remember that no matter how intelligent and endearing they may seem, your non-elf slaves are animals, nothing more. Do not indulge them, but give them every day a new reason to fear your wrath and a fresh reminder that your power is absolute. It is not going too far, if you can afford it, to select one at random now and again for death by torture. As well as providing entertainment for your guests and an example for your children, this practice instils a healthy…

Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Title	The Great War against the Dragons
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Description	An ancient book.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content01	The dragons saw how the elves were changing the world, bringing beauty to blasted volcanic wastes, and living green to barren fields of rock. They had never seen beauty before, nor heard music; their language was devoid of poetry, and their magic was brutal and without wonder.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content02	The dragons fell in love with the elves, as all do who see them. They longed to possess them, for dragons are avaricious by nature. With sweet words and trickery they enslaved a few of the fair people, but most elves were not taken in by the dragons' flattery, and prepared to resist them.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content03	Great battles were fought, blade against flame, and magic against magic. Mountains were leveled, and land sank to make the Inner Sea. The tunnels where the dwarves hid in fear were flooded. It was in that bloody crucible that our people's mastery of magic was forged, and the elven race united under the first Emperor Ilmathir Ellanion.
Equipment/&Abjuration_DragonsWar_Content04	The war against the dragons lasted for three generations before the Warrior Empress Cythaeriel Ellanion, the Lady of the Bright Blade, led the elves to…

Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Title	Illusion and Substance: A Primer
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Description	A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content01	…as Master Irillien of the Arcaneum wrote in his great work "On the Nature of Illusion and the Question of Reality," "Many illusions, if believed, are as effective as if they were real; conversely, some realities, if ignored, may be avoided. Which, then, is more valid? What, indeed, is real, or reality? Was our great Empire, and our rightful mastery of the world and all who dwell therein, not a dream, which is a form of illusion, before our Iron Legions and our arcanists made it real?"
Equipment/&Illusion_Book1_Content02	There is some merit, therefore, in avoiding a distinction between illusion and reality, but regarding them instead as two poles of a continuum. Some things are entirely real, and some things are entirely illusory, but the numbers of each are far fewer than is commonly supposed. Most things lie somewhere in between, partaking of the natures of illusion and reality in differing proportions. Those who seek a true understanding of the nature of things, and the distinctions…
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Title	Human Gods and Their Magic
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Description	A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content01	…exploration of the planes outside our own revealed the existence of all manner of strange entities, some of them exceptionally powerful. It is to be supposed that the world of Tirmar, from which the humans came with their gods, belongs in one of these planes, which somehow collided with our own during the events leading up to the Cataclysm, instead of remaining safely confined beyond a magical portal.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book2_Content02	The reason for this is unknown. Several theories have been put forward, but none has been proven. Although they vary in their finer details, many theories blame the deity Sorr-Tarr, from whom the humans and their gods were fleeing as they entered Solasta. The scholars of the Arcaneum do not fully understand the class of beings called "gods" or "deities," and while their human followers proudly assert that their powers are without limit, it is clear that this cannot be the case, or the Cataclysm would have been prevented. Still, this Sorr-Tarr, being a powerful entity of this class, might have sought to open the Rift wider, in order to facilitate the pursuit by his Sorr-Akkath followers and complete…
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Title	On Those Who Came from Tirmar
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Description	A book written in high elvish.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content01	…humans and Sorr-Akkath are thought to be the only mortal beings to cross from Tirmar, the question of orcs and their kin must be taken into account. Human accounts of the matter are confused and often contradict each other, but a careful reading of the best sources suggests that the orcs were once human, and were altered by the wild magics that accompanied the closing of the Rift.
Equipment/&Illusion_Book3_Content02	The human ancestors of the orcs were members of wild barbarian tribes from the more remote parts of Tirmar. Ferocity and courage in battle were the highest values in their culture, so when the forces of our two worlds combined at the Battle of the Rift, it was these tribes who sought out the most dangerous locations in order to win the most glory by the values of their culture. This brought them very close to the Rift itself, and therefore made them most vulnerable to the unpredictable magical energies that flared out from it. All of those who fought beside them perished, even the elite of the Iron Legions - but somehow these barbarians, strong of mind and strong of body, were able to survive. However, their bodies and minds were both affected, and they became the first orcs to exist in both worlds.

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeCaptureGiantReport_Title	A Small Giant Problem
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeCaptureGiantReport_Description	Hasdrubal: \n My patrol stumbled upon some tracks in the middle of the swamp, not far from base. Looks like giants. One seemed to be stalking the others, or possibly running from them. It was hard to tell. We took one prisoner, at no small risk to our hides. Be advised that we are bringing back a prisoner who will need a very secure cell.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeCaptureGiantHasdrubalOrders_Title	A Dangerous Guest
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeCaptureGiantHasdrubalOrders_Description	Giants are too powerful to be left wandering around, and besides, this one knows the location of our camp. Capture the creature and keep it in chains until further notice.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeDryadThreatReport_Title	Tree of Death
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeDryadThreatReport_Description	Hasdrubal: \n While on patrol, Garral camped near the big tree with his troops. In the morning, everyone was dead except one sentry who neither saw nor heard anything. \n We just had word from some merchants who had set up camp near the same tree, and their sentry tells an identical tale. \n Also, one of our patrols found the corpses of several troops in the livery of Orenetis not far from this same tree. While our troops shed no tears over their fate, concern is spreading about this tree. I strongly recommend that some action be taken. We've chased dryads away from that tree. Maybe it's them, somehow, retaliating.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeOrcSwampBaseReport_Title	A Heavy Raid
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeOrcSwampBaseReport_Description	Hasdrubal: \n One of our patrols reports that an orc raiding party has settled in the old fort: you know the one. They are using it as a base to raid through the swamp as well as to strike at targets nearer the city, which, of course, brings unwanted attention in our direction. Please send someone to convince them to move away.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeWanderingElfReport_Title	Lonely Traveler
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeWanderingElfReport_Description	Hasdrubal: \n Some of our scouts spotted a solitary elf traveling alone. From his gear, he looks to be a mage, but his purpose is unclear. A spy? Someone sent to the swamps as a punishment? I suggest someone make contact and talk to him, but this should be done far away from the camp.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeRebelMeetingReport_Title	Trouble with the Rebels
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeRebelMeetingReport_Description	Hasdrubal: \n I think it is time you involved yourself directly in our meetings. The Rebellion's demands are beginning to overtax our resources, and they won't take no for an answer. I am wondering whether they are planning something. We must tread carefully.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_PaganRitual_Title	Fragments of Worship
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_PaganRitual_Description	Water is life! When entering the sacred waters, conduct the purification rituals for your body, your mind, and your soul! Let the waters wash and guide you! But remember: any darkness in your heart may transform the water of life into the water of death! \n …\n And as the heathens descended on our temple, the waters rose to meet them. There was a thorough cleansing of the filth in their souls.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportUndead_Title	Undead on the March!
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportUndead_Description	Hasdrubal: \n A patrol reports undead activity near the old bridge. This is new as the area was quiet before. We should investigate. Perhaps some idiot opened an opulent tomb, and we only need to find the entrance. \n I just hope it isn't some hidden necropolis with scores and scores of undead inside. That would force us to redirect resources from many operations until we are able to resolve the issue.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportTrolls_Title	Tunnel and Trolls!
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ForgeReportTrolls_Description	Hasdrubal: \n During our last patrol, we spotted some trolls entering the big caves. They were too many for us to fight, so we waited and watched. They seem ready to settle down there, and one of my scouts swears there were some young trolls among them. As the caves are near one of our main routes, this spells trouble. Please send reinforcements immediately - and make sure they bring lots of torches and oil. We'll need them!

Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_DominionOrderToConfiscateFood_Description	The benevolence of our Lord Protector does not extend to the care of rebels who cannot and will not acknowledge their good fortune.

Under the Sigil of Orenetis, Lord Protector. Signed: Orenetis

This will end soon, one way or the other! \n With my love, always!\n Joson
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_WitchHuntLetter02_Title	Letter to Joson
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_WitchHuntLetter02_Description	My dearest brother, \n Please, let it be. Put this foolish quest behind you and come back to your family! There is only madness to be found going after a witch - and keep in mind: she will be after not only your body, but also your soul! I know Maraike protects us all, but a witch is a servant of the dark powers! Please, Joson, come back to town and stay with us! Brighten our evenings with your music! \n Your brother, Hannik
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_OrenetisDraconicStudy_Title	Polymorphing Report
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_OrenetisDraconicStudy_Description	The problem isn't physical. As far as we can tell, our Lord Protector is healthy. That he can't revert to his higher form…\n  …can only mean that there is one fundamental aspect of the process that we fail to grasp. \n Therefore, we must continue to experiment on the most diverse array of subjects possible, morphing animals and even those ridiculous pets that druids dare to call kindred spirits. In these links and experiments, we shall find the key to free our Lord.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport01_Title	Hybrid Dire Wolves - Progress Report, Phase Three
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport01_Description	The changes we wrought on the dire wolves enhanced their aggression and ferocity. They look ugly and their stench can be overwhelming, but when we pitted them against unaltered pure breeds of their kind, there wasn't even a contest. The second test involved armed runaway rebels, who were also slaughtered with ease. All in all, the program is delivering on its initial promise. The next step will be to ensure that the mutations carry over to the next generation.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport02_Title	Hybrid Bears - Progress Report, Phase Four
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport02_Description	My Lord: \n As you know, our work with the bears has been very successful. Their ferocity and strength are unrivaled. They are truly fearsome. But there is better news yet. Last night, one of our bears gave birth to two healthy cubs, showing all the signs of our work. We have made the changes hereditary! However, the ferocity of the species is such that the young did not survive long, as their first mewling caused their enraged father to kill them.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport03_Title	Hybrid Bulette - Progress Report, Phase Two
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_HybridTestReport03_Description	My Lord: \n Phase two of testing is complete. The bulette shows much promise: its carapace is harder, its enhanced muscles give it added jumping capabilities, and its jaw can even crush rocks. To proceed with phase three of testing, we will need worthwhile adversaries to push it to its limits and prove the success of the work so far.
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ResearchReportOnSitenero_Title	Special Guest - Monthly Report
Equipment/&DLC1_Equipment_Document_ResearchReportOnSitenero_Description	To our Lord Protector, Orenetis the Benevolent: \n My Lord, the behavior of our guest follows its usual patterns: long periods of contemplation, some calisthenics, and not much in the way of conversation. Somewhat unusually, there was no attempt at bribery during this observation period. I might hope that he has learned better than to try it, but I suspect he plans to lull us into relaxing our guard. Not that we would do that after the mishap twenty years ago. The fate of that set of guards was a stark reminder of the price of shirking one's duty.

We will see tomorrow.
