Tip/&LoadingTip01	Casting spells consumes spell slots. Most classes regain spell slots after a long rest.

Tip/&LoadingTip05	Spells consume spell slots when cast, unlike cantrips which can be cast at will.
Tip/&LoadingTip06	Taking a long rest is the main way to recover all your spell slots, although wizards can use Arcane Recovery to recover a few low-level slots during short rests.

Tip/&LoadingTip09	Clerics and paladins always know all the spells they can cast at their level, but still need to prepare those they want to be able to cast.

Tip/&LoadingTip13	Some creatures are afraid of light and can even be hurt by it, allowing you to use light as a weapon.
Tip/&LoadingTip14	To perform a long rest, you must find a suitable place: either an inn such as the Gravekeep's Cask, or a campfire when exploring.
Tip/&LoadingTip15	In each turn of battle, a character has a main action and a bonus action. The main action is used to move or attack, for instance, while bonus actions are granted by specific class features, spells, or powers.
Tip/&LoadingTip16	Reactions allow them to interrupt someone else's action, for instance, to perform an opportunity attack. Each character can make one reaction, and recover it at the start of their next turn.
Tip/&LoadingTip17	Some characters or monsters can attack more than once per turn, and can move between attacks.
Tip/&LoadingTip18	Shoving can push an enemy one cell away or put them down until they get up. Enemies can shove, too.
Tip/&LoadingTip19	Dodging is a powerful defense even if it uses your main action: enemies have disadvantage on hitting you for the remainder of your turn.

Tip/&LoadingTip21	In combat, you can move normally and then dash as your main action to go twice as far.

Tip/&LoadingTip23	Most characters can climb two cells without a problem. Climbing higher requires strength, and proficiency with Athletics helps a lot. Some characters, like thieves or darkweavers, have superior climbing abilities.
Tip/&LoadingTip25	After moving the camera around to examine your surroundings, you can center on a character and follow them. Either double-click the character's portrait or press TAB while controlling this character.
Tip/&LoadingTip26	To better navigate in three dimensions, activate/deactivate the camera planar mode, with the button in the center of the compass (bottom right of the screen).
Tip/&LoadingTip27	Flying spells or artifacts can let you move almost anywhere you want. But losing concentration means falling - possibly to your death.
Tip/&LoadingTip28	When a battle starts, all creatures involved roll initiative to determine the play order. High dexterity raises your initiative.
Tip/&LoadingTip29	Battles sometimes begin with one side being surprised. Surprised characters or creatures cannot act during the first round of battle.
Tip/&LoadingTip30	You can set up weapon slots to change quickly from sword and shield to bow, for example, or to draw a torch along with a one-handed weapon. Prepare any combo you like.
Tip/&LoadingTip31	Many consumables can be set up in the utility slot, making them available more quickly than the inventory would.
Tip/&LoadingTip32	When you find a mysterious item, use Detect Magic first to determine whether it has magical properties. If it does, use Identify to learn how to use it.
Tip/&LoadingTip33	Ingredients are various items like flowers, powders, and magic gems, allowing you to craft a variety of items, from healing potions to powerful magic swords.
Tip/&LoadingTip34	To craft, you need the relevant proficiency. Your ability scores matter, too. For instance, to craft a scroll you need proficiency with the scroll kit, and Arcana will help a lot.
Tip/&LoadingTip35	Crafting can be performed during downtime while traveling. A character with a crafting operation in progress works on their task before sleeping.
Tip/&LoadingTip36	Personality flags influence the dialog lines spoken by a character. They don't make choices for you - they simply change the flavor of the experience.
Tip/&LoadingTip37	When speaking to an NPC, the most suitable character in the party will automatically use Insight to guess which approach is most likely to work with them.
Tip/&LoadingTip38	Your group has a specific level of relations with each of the game's factions. The more they like you, the more items they will sell you, and the lower their prices will be.
Tip/&LoadingTip39	When bringing back items from the Badlands, choose which faction to sell them to. This will influence your relations with them.
Tip/&LoadingTip40	Disengage can be used as a main action, allowing you to move outside the enemies' range without risking opportunity attacks.
Tip/&LoadingTip41	When an enemy is in a neighboring cell, you are engaged. If you move away from that enemy, you risk suffering an opportunity attack.
Tip/&LoadingTip42	Rogues can use sneak attack to increase their damage when they attack an enemy that is in a cell next to an ally, unless they have disadvantage on their attack roll.
Tip/&LoadingTip43	Wielding two light weapons allows you to perform a second attack with your bonus actions. Both weapons need the Light tag.
Tip/&LoadingTip44	Wielding a finesse weapon allows you to use Dexterity as the main ability score for the attack, if it is better than Strength. Check for the Finesse tag.
Tip/&LoadingTip45	A weapon with the Versatile tag can be used with one or two hands. If you leave the second hand slot empty, you'll deal more damage with such a weapon. Example: a longsword.
Tip/&LoadingTip47	To level up, your characters need to take a long rest. They will gain their new power when waking up.
Tip/&LoadingTip12	At the edge of your light sources, the environment is in dim light. You don't need Darkvision to see in dim light.
Tip/&LoadingTip11	Lighting is a crucial element of the game; characters without Darkvision will attack an unlit foe with disadvantage. Use torches and light spells to illuminate your environment.
Tip/&LoadingTip46	To split a stack of items, drag and drop the stack onto an empty cell while holding down the CTRL key. This will take one unit from the stack.
Tip/&LoadingTip24	Levitation spells and artifacts allow you to float up or down instead of climbing. You can also force an enemy to float in mid-air instead of rushing toward you if its size is medium or smaller.
Tip/&LoadingTip48	You can change the difficulty settings of the game on the fly at any time.
Tip/&LoadingTip49	If you experience lag/latency in multiplayer, lower the graphical settings/quality level on the slowest machines.
