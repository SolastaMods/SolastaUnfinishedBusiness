Subclass/&DHWarlockSubclassElementalPatronDescription	You've been made a pact with and been changed by primordials present in the elemental badlands. The elemental chaos of the patron has suffused your soul, letting you use the power of different elemental types.

Subclass/&DHWarlockSubclassRiftWalkerDescription	Your patron is one of the rare beings who calls the void between worlds their home. They slip between the planes with ease and the knowledge you have gained from interacting with them allows you to harness lingering rift energies to your benefit within solasta. You might be sometimes filled with a longing for the distant realm of your patron, a desire to wander between dimensions for the rest of your days, or watch for signs of another Rift event, either to prevent or encourage.

Subclass/&WarlockAncientForestDescription	You have forged a relationship with a powerful nature entity: Ancient Dryads, Archdruids, Manifestations of the Feywild bleeding into the material plane, Forgotten gods from a primal age. Your patron may wish for you to protect the natural world, travel to far off lands that it cannot, or it may have another motive that seems inscrutable to short-lived mortals.

Subclass/&WarlockMoonLitDescription	Your patron is a spirit of the moon, an entity that embodies the cyclical nature of light and darkness. These spirits seek to maintain the power of the moon over the night sky while keeping profane powers that stalk the darkness at bay and task their warlocks with the same, granting them command over the powers of the moon and its effects.

Subclass/&WarlockUrPriestDescription	While the vast majority of divine spellcasters gain their powers from a deity, there are those who despise the gods. Those who call themselves Ur-priests have learned to siphon off the divine energies granted by gods to their divine spellcasters, using it for their own needs without giving even lip-service to any god. As an Ur-priest, you differ from most warlocks, lacking a patron who grants you your power. Eldritch Invocations you uncover are warped forms of magic the gods might grant their patrons, while Pact Boons are likely divine artefacts you have managed to steal.
